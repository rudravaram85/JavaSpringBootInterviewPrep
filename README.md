## 1. What is Spring?

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* ✅ Enterprise-grade Java framework enabling easier integration, configuration, and extensibility in apps.
* 🚀 Provides modules for IoC/DI, JDBC, MVC, AOP, Security, and more.
* 🧩 Helps build loosely-coupled, testable, maintainable applications.
* 🤖 Powers microservices with Spring Boot support.
* 🔧 Reduces boilerplate via annotations and auto‑configuration.

**Summary**
Spring is a comprehensive Java framework that standardizes enterprise development by offering core services like inversion of control, AOP, security, and MVC. It promotes modularity, configuration flexibility (XML, Java, annotations), and integrates well with databases, messaging, and web services. Spring Boot simplifies setup with embedded servers and convention-over-configuration. It fosters testable, maintainable, production-grade systems suitable for cloud deployment.

```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan("com.example.app")
public class AppConfig { }

@Component
public class HelloService {
    public String sayHello() { return "Hello, Spring!"; }
}

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
        var svc = ctx.getBean(HelloService.class);
        System.out.println(svc.sayHello()); // prints Hello, Spring!
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: Why choose Spring over older frameworks like Struts or plain Servlets?
   **A**: Spring offers holistic support for DI, AOP, transaction management, REST, security, and testability, reducing boilerplate and enhancing modularity.

2. **Q**: What are major Spring modules?
   **A**: Spring Core (IoC/DI), AOP, Spring MVC, Spring Data/JDBC/JPA, Spring Security, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, etc.

3. **Q**: Can you use Spring without Spring Boot?
   **A**: Absolutely—Spring Core works standalone. Boot is optional and just streamlines configuration with embedded web server and starters.

## 2. Jakarta EE vs Spring

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 🔄 Both support dependency injection and web capabilities.
* 🤝 Jakarta EE uses standards (Servlet, CDI, JPA) via containers like Payara/WildFly.
* ⚙️ Spring uses its own contracts and often easier microservice-first stack via Boot.
* 📦 Deployment: Spring Boot produces self‑contained JARs; Jakarta EE runs on external app‑servers.
* 🧪 Testing: Spring Boot has embedded-test support via @SpringBootTest.

**Summary**
Jakarta EE and Spring are industry-leading Java ecosystems. Jakarta EE emphasizes standardized APIs with vendor-neutral containers (EJB, CDI, JAX-RS). Spring offers richer ecosystem, convention-over-configuration approach via Boot, fast startup, and standalone deployments. Use EE for pure-Java-standards consistency across vendors; Spring for flexibility, cloud readiness, and extensive ecosystem. Both can interop—Spring supports JPA, JAX-RS, etc.

```java
// Jakarta EE example: JAX-RS endpoint
@Path("/hello")
@RequestScoped
public class HelloResource {
    @GET @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello() { return "Hello, Jakarta EE!"; }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: When to pick Jakarta EE over Spring?
   **A**: Choose Jakarta EE when you need vendor-neutral portability and strict Java EE standard compliance.

2. **Q**: Can Spring Boot run on an external servlet container?
   **A**: Yes, by packaging as WAR and configuring a Servlet initializer instead of embedding Tomcat/Jetty.

3. **Q**: Does Spring fully support JPA?
   **A**: Yes—Spring Data JPA supports JPA implementations like Hibernate, EclipseLink.

## 3. Introduction to Spring Core

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 💡 Foundation of Spring, providing IoC container, bean lifecycle, DI.
* 📚 Includes ApplicationContext (BeanFactory), resource loading, property support.
* 🔧 Uses @Component, XML, or Java @Bean for bean definitions.
* 👁️‍🗨️ Supports environment abstraction, profiles, and event publishing.
* 🔄 Manages configuration and wiring across layers.

**Summary**
Spring Core is the heart of the framework—its IoC container instantiates, configures, and connects beans via various metadata sources. It offers ApplicationContext interface with lifecycle callbacks, property resolution, resource access, and event system. Beans can be discovered by scanning or declared manually. This abstraction simplifies program architecture by delegating wiring and lifecycle management.

```java
@Configuration
public class CoreConfig {
  @Bean
  public GreetingService greetingService() { return new GreetingServiceImpl(); }
}
public class App {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    var ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(CoreConfig.class);
    System.out.println(ctx.getBean(GreetingService.class).greet());
  }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: What’s the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext?
   **A**: ApplicationContext extends BeanFactory—it eagerly loads singleton beans, supports messages, events, and resource access, not just lazy instantiation.

2. **Q**: How do you define beans?
   **A**: Via XML, Java @Configuration methods with @Bean, or component-scanning using stereotypes (@Component, @Service).

3. **Q**: Can beans be prototype-scoped?
   **A**: Yes. Use `@Scope("prototype")` for multi-instance behavior instead of singleton.

---

## 4. Introduction to IoC & DI

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 🧩 IoC reverses control of object creation to framework.
* 🔌 DI injects dependencies (constructor, setter, field).
* 💻 Simplifies testing—swap implementations easily.
* 🔄 Promotes separation of concerns and loose coupling.
* 💡 Increases modularity and configuration flexibility.

**Summary**
Inversion of Control (IoC) delegates responsibility for managing object lifecycle and dependencies to the Spring container. Dependency Injection (DI) is an implementation of IoC—framework injects collaborators rather than objects manually wiring them. DI improves modularity, testability, and easier configuration. It supports constructor, setter, and field injection.

```java
@Component class A { }
@Component class B {
  private final A a;
  @Autowired
  public B(A a) { this.a = a; }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: Difference between setter and constructor injection?
   **A**: Constructor injection is recommended: makes dependencies required and immutable. Setter injection is optional or circular dependencies.

2. **Q**: Can DI be done without a framework?
   **A**: Yes, manually via new and passing in dependencies. IoC frameworks automate it and scale better.

3. **Q**: When would you use field injection?
   **A**: Rarely—only for test code or highly non‑modular cases. Constructor injection remains preferred.

---

## 5. Demo of IoC & DI

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 👨‍💻 Demonstrates automatic instantiation and injection.
* 🧪 Includes a mock configuration for testing.
* ✅ Shows one-to-many implementation injection.
* 🔁 Wiring via Java config or XML.

**Summary**
In this demo, we define interfaces and implementations wired by Spring. We show constructor injection and switching implementations via profiles or config. This demonstrates loose coupling and easy test swapping. The demo proves DI in action, where class B doesn’t create A but receives it through IoC container wiring.

```java
public interface MessageProvider { String getMessage(); }
@Component @Profile("dev")
public class DevMessageProvider implements MessageProvider { public String getMessage() { return "Dev"; } }
@Component @Profile("prod")
public class ProdMessageProvider implements MessageProvider { public String getMessage() { return "Prod"; } }

@Component class UseMessage {
  private final MessageProvider provider;
  @Autowired
  public UseMessage(MessageProvider provider) { this.provider = provider; }
  public void show() { System.out.println(provider.getMessage()); }
}

public class Demo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.setProperty("spring.profiles.active", "dev");
    var ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext("com.example");
    ctx.getBean(UseMessage.class).show(); // prints "Dev"
  }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: What if multiple beans match DI type?
   **A**: Use @Qualifier or @Primary to resolve ambiguity.

2. **Q**: How to change profile at runtime?
   **A**: Set spring.profiles.active via System property, environment var, or application.properties.

3. **Q**: How to inject a collection of beans?
   **A**: `@Autowired List<MyInterface> allImpls;` injects all matching beans.

---

## 6. Advantages of IoC & DI

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 🔁 Decoupling implementation from usage.
* 🧪 Easier unit testing via mocks.
* 🔄 Easier to swap implementations in deployment.
* 🔍 Centralized wiring and lifecycle management.
* 🌱 Encourages single responsibility and cleaner modules.

**Summary**
IoC and DI improve code quality by decoupling components and externalizing wiring. This boosts modularity, simplifies testing, and allows flexible configuration without code changes. This style aids maintainability, supports evolving requirements, and enables easier refactoring. In large apps, IoC avoids tight coupling and deep dependency chains.

```java
@Service class AService { }
@Service class BService {
  private final AService aService;
  @Autowired BService(AService a) { this.aService = a; }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: How does DI enhance testing?
   **A**: You can inject mocks or stubs instead of real implementations in unit tests.

2. **Q**: What inversion of control containers are besides Spring?
   **A**: Google Guice, Jakarta CDI (Weld/OpenWebBeans), PicoContainer.

3. **Q**: Any disadvantages to DI?
   **A**: Some learning curve, container complexity, potential runtime misconfiguration.

---

## 7. Introductions to Beans, Context, and SpEL

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 🧩 "Bean": managed object in Spring container.
* 🌳 "Context": ApplicationContext gives lifecycle, DI, event, resource APIs.
* 🔤 SpEL: Spring Expression Language used in annotations like `@Value`.
* 🔍 SpEL supports method calls, arithmetic, collection access.
* 🛠️ Leverages SpEL for dynamic configuration and condition evaluation.

**Summary**
Beans are Spring-managed objects declared via XML, Java, or annotations. The ApplicationContext is the central factory for beans, configuration, and eventing. SpEL empowers dynamic expressions such as property access, math, conditional, and calling custom functions. Used in `@Value`, bean definitions, security, and conditional loading.

```java
@Value("#{T(java.lang.Math).random() * 100}")
private double rand;

@Value("#{systemProperties['user.home']}")
private String homeDir;
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: What’s SpEL vs JSP EL or OGNL?
   **A**: SpEL is for Spring metadata config with method execution, arithmetic, indexing—embedded in annotations/XML.

2. **Q**: Can SpEL reference other beans?
   **A**: Yes: `@Value("#{otherBean.someProperty}")`

3. **Q**: What happens on SpEL parse error?
   **A**: Context initialization fails with ExpressionException.

## 8. Introduction to Spring IoC Container

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 🏛️ IoC Container manages bean instantiation, wiring, lifecycle.
* 📦 Bean definitions loaded via ApplicationContext from Java, XML, or classpath.
* 🔁 Supports scopes: singleton, prototype, request, session.
* 🔄 Supports lifecycle callbacks like `@PostConstruct` & `@PreDestroy`.
* 🔍 Also supports Aware interfaces, events, and custom post‑processors.

**Summary**
The Spring IoC Container, represented by BeanFactory/ApplicationContext, is the runtime environment where beans live. It uses metadata to instantiate, configure, and link beans, supports scopes and lifecycle, and adds cross‑cutting services like events. Developers define beans via Java classes, XML, or scan for annotated components. The container handles dependency resolution, lifecycle hooks, and context-wide features.

```java
@Configuration
public class Cfg {
  @Bean(initMethod="init", destroyMethod="cleanup")
  public ResourceHolder rh() { return new ResourceHolder(); }
}
public class Demo {
  var ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(Cfg.class);
  ctx.close(); // triggers destroyMethod
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: How do prototype scoping and container shutdown differ?
   **A**: Prototype beans aren’t tracked by context, so destroy callbacks aren’t called automatically.

2. **Q**: What is BeanPostProcessor?
   **A**: Interface to apply custom logic before/after bean initialization.

3. **Q**: What is BeanFactoryPostProcessor?
   **A**: Modifies bean definitions before container bean instantiation begins.

## 10. Creating Beans inside Spring Context

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 📦 Beans defined through Java @Bean or @Component scanning.
* 🌲 Configuration classes act as bean factories.
* ♻️ You can create beans programmatically using `registrar.registerBean()`.
* 🔁 Beans can be conditionally created via `@Conditional`, `@Profile`.
* 🧪 Useful for dynamic or modular bean registration.

**Summary**
Spring allows bean registration via annotations and XML. Java-based configuration via `@Bean` is concise and type-safe. `@Component` with scanning auto-detects. You can also manually register beans at runtime using `GenericApplicationContext.registerBean()`, enabling dynamic modules or plugin patterns. Conditional annotations help fine-tune when beans exist.

```java
public class DynamicDemo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    var ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();
    ctx.register(DynamicDemo.class);
    ctx.registerBean("foo", String.class, () -> "Dynamically registered");
    ctx.refresh();
    System.out.println(ctx.getBean("foo"));
    ctx.close();
  }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: How to register beans at runtime?
   **A**: Use `registerBean()` on `GenericApplicationContext` before `refresh()`.

2. **Q**: What’s the advantage of Java @Bean over XML?
   **A**: Type safety, easier refactoring, IDE support, and conditional registration via code.

3. **Q**: Can two beans share the same class?
   **A**: Yes—give them different names via `@Bean("name")` or `@Component("...")`.

---

## 🧩 Understanding NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException in Spring

**Use‑case & Highlights**

* Thrown when multiple bean candidates match a required type.
* Occurs with `@Autowired` by type without qualifiers.
* Indicates ambiguous wiring in DI context.
* Fixable by `@Qualifier` or `@Primary`.
* Helps prevent runtime mis-wiring errors.

**Summary**
`NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException` is thrown when DI attempts to inject a type but finds more than one matching bean. It alerts developers to ambiguity in bean configuration. The solution is to mark one bean as `@Primary` or use `@Qualifier` to specify which bean to inject. It's critical for avoiding unexpected runtime behavior in complex contexts with multiple implementations.

```java
@Component class A1 implements Service {}
@Component class A2 implements Service {}

@Component class UseSvc {
  @Autowired @Qualifier("a2") Service svc;
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: How to fix this exception automatically?
   **A**: Use `@Primary` on the default bean implementation.

2. **Q**: Can you specify qualifier at injection point?
   **A**: Yes: `@Qualifier("beanName")`.

3. **Q**: What if using constructor injection?
   **A**: Qualifier goes on constructor parameter: `public C(@Qualifier("x") Service s)`.

---

## 📝 Providing a custom name to the bean

**Use‑case & Highlights**

* Names beans explicitly via `@Component("myBean")` or `@Bean("myBean")`.
* Helps when multiple beans of same type exist.
* Makes XML references and `@Qualifier` simpler.
* Aids readability and maintainability.
* Supports legacy integration with specific bean IDs.

**Summary**
Custom bean naming gives explicit control over Spring-managed instance identification. By default, bean name is derived from class or method. Specifying names is essential when multiple implementations of an interface exist. Named beans support clearer wiring and reduce ambiguity. This practice aids debugging in larger applications.

```java
@Component("fastSvc")
public class FastService implements TaskService {}

@Component("slowSvc")
public class SlowService implements TaskService {}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: What is default bean name for `@Component`?
   **A**: The uncapitalized class name, e.g., `fastService`.

2. **Q**: Can you assign multiple names?
   **A**: Yes: `@Component({"bean1","aliasBean"})`.

3. **Q**: How to inject named bean?
   **A**: Use `@Qualifier("beanName")` along with `@Autowired`.

---

## ⭐ Understanding @Primary Annotation in Spring

**Use‑case & Highlights**

* Marks a bean as default when duplicates exist.
* Eliminates need for `@Qualifier` in many cases.
* Useful in library-provided fallback beans.
* Works with `@Configuration` and `@Component`.
* Can be overridden with explicit qualifiers.

**Summary**
`@Primary` marks a bean as preferred when multiple beans of the same type are candidates. This solves `NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException` without qualifiers. Though convenient, qualifiers should still be used when explicit control is desired. `@Primary` provides safe fallback for most injection scenarios and helps reduce boilerplate.

```java
@Component
@Primary
public class DefaultSvc implements TaskService {}

@Component
public class SpecialSvc implements TaskService {}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: Which wins: `@Primary` or `@Qualifier`?
   **A**: `@Qualifier` always overrides `@Primary`.

2. **Q**: Can you combine them?
   **A**: Yes—primary on one, qualifier to narrow down in edge cases.

3. **Q**: Scope usage?
   **A**: Scoping unaffected—`@Primary` only concerns selection priority.

---

## 🏷️ Creating Beans using @Component Annotation

**Use‑case & Highlights**

* Auto-detected by classpath scanning.
* Frees you from manual `@Bean` definition.
* Stereotypes: `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`.
* Supports default bean naming.
* Encourages modular, decoupled design.

**Summary**
`@Component` and its stereotypes allow Spring to auto-detect and register beans during component scanning. This convention-driven approach reduces annotation clutter and promotes clear intent. Developers annotate classes once and dependencies are injected automatically. Fully supports lifecycle management, AOP, and custom naming. Widely used in modern Spring applications.

```java
@Component
public class GreetingService {
  public String greet() { return "Hi!"; }
}

@Component
public class GreetRunner implements CommandLineRunner {
  @Autowired private GreetingService svc;
  @Override public void run(String... args) { System.out.println(svc.greet()); }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: What's the scan path?
   **A**: Defined via `@ComponentScan(basePackages="com.example")` or by default root package.

2. **Q**: Can you exclude components?
   **A**: Yes—use `excludeFilters` in `@ComponentScan`, or `@Profile`.

3. **Q**: What stereotype for DAOs?
   **A**: Use `@Repository`, which also translates DB exceptions.

---

## 📚 Stereotype Annotations in Spring

**Use‑case & Highlights**

* Classifies roles: `@Controller`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Component`.
* Adds role-specific behavior (e.g. exception translation).
* Improves readability/maintenance.
* Enables automatic scanning and AOP application.
* Semantic clarity in architecture.

**Summary**
Spring’s stereotype annotations provide semantic meaning and enable classpath scanning and AOP features. `@Controller` marks web controllers, `@Service` for business logic, `@Repository` for DAO with exception translation, and `@Component` for generic. These annotations help clearly define responsibilities and allow the container to apply appropriate processing.

```java
@Repository
public class UserRepo {
  public User find(String id) { /* JDBC or JPA logic */ }
}

@Service
public class UserService {
  @Autowired private UserRepo repo;
  public User getUser(String id) { return repo.find(id); }
}

@Controller
public class UserController {
  @Autowired private UserService svc;
  @GetMapping("/user")
  public User get(@RequestParam String id) { return svc.getUser(id); }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: How is `@Repository` special?
   **A**: It triggers Spring’s exception translation for persistence errors.

2. **Q**: What AOP proxies controllers?
   **A**: Spring MVC uses `@Controller` to map HTTP handlers; proxies not applied by default.

3. **Q**: Can service layer have transaction management?
   **A**: Yes—use `@Service` + `@Transactional` to demarcate business transactions.

Here are well-structured deep-dives into each topic, including real-world use-cases, summaries with code snippets, and interview Q\&A.

---

## 1. Comparison between `@Bean` vs `@Component`

### 🔍 Use-case example & explanations

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
  @Bean
  public PaymentService paymentService() {
    return new PaymentServiceImpl();
  }
}

@Component
public class OrderService {
  @Autowired PaymentService paymentService;
}
```

* **@Bean** defined in a `@Configuration` class returns exactly one bean.
* **@Component** auto-detected by classpath scanning.
* `@Bean` allows complex setup logic, conditional creation, runtime parameters.
* `@Component` is simpler and quicker when no configuration logic is needed.
* Both register beans in application context to be autowired.

### 🔚 Summary (≈5 lines)

`@Bean` gives explicit control and flexibility in method-based bean creation, ideal for factory-style logic. `@Component` offers auto-detection with less boilerplate. Use `@Bean` for third-party classes or custom instantiation logic; use `@Component` for clean, self-contained business classes. Both integrate into Spring DI container.

```java
@Bean PaymentService paymentService() { return new PaymentServiceImpl(); }
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A

**1. What's the difference between @Bean and @Component?**
@Bean is method-level, used inside @Configuration, while @Component is class-level and scanned by classpath.

**2. When would you choose @Bean over @Component?**
When instantiating third-party types or needing complex init logic.

**3. Can both inject dependencies?**
Yes—both register as beans and support @Autowired, @Qualifier, etc.

## 2. Understanding `@PostConstruct` Annotation

### 🔍 Use-case example & explanations

```java
@Component
public class CacheLoader {
  private Map<String,String> cache = new HashMap<>();
  @Autowired FileService fileService;

  @PostConstruct
  public void init() {
    cache = fileService.loadAll();
  }
}
```

* Runs after bean instantiation, dependency injection complete.
* Ideal for initialising resources or caches.
* Eliminates the need for `InitializingBean` interface.
* Supports exception handling—fails context start on error.
* Executes before bean is available for use by other beans.

### 🔚 Summary

`@PostConstruct` marks an initialization method called once dependencies are injected but before any business logic runs. It simplifies setup routines like cache loading or DB connection pooling without implementing lifecycle interfaces. Execution occurs before bean is available to clients.

```java
@PostConstruct void init() { cache = fileService.loadAll(); }
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A

**1. When is @PostConstruct invoked?**
After injection and before bean is ready for use.

**2. What if init method throws an exception?**
Bean fails to initialize, blocking context startup.

**3. Alternatives to @PostConstruct?**
Implement `InitializingBean.afterPropertiesSet()` or specify `init-method` in XML.

---

## 3. Understanding `@PreDestroy` Annotation

### 🔍 Use-case example & explanations

```java
@Component
public class TemporaryFileCleaner {
  private Path tempDir = Paths.get("/tmp/app");

  @PreDestroy
  public void cleanup() throws IOException {
    Files.walk(tempDir).forEach(Files::delete);
  }
}
```

* Called before bean removal and context shutdown.
* Useful for releasing resources: closing files, sockets, cleanup.
* Less boilerplate than `DisposableBean`.
* Works even if shutdown commanded programmatically or by container.
* Ensures safe termination logic runs.

### 🔚 Summary

`@PreDestroy` marks a cleanup method that runs before bean destruction, ideal for freeing resources, deleting temporary files, closing DB/sockets. It simplifies DI-managed lifecycle without implementing Spring interfaces.

```java
@PreDestroy void cleanup() throws IOException { … }
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A

**1. When does @PreDestroy execute?**
Before bean destruction during context shutdown.

**2. What if cleanup method fails?**
Exception logs; shutdown continues—but application context may warn.

**3. Alternatives to @PreDestroy?**
Use `DisposableBean.destroy()` or XML `destroy-method`.

---

## 4. Creating Beans Programmatically using `registerBean()`

### 🔍 Use-case example & explanations

```java
AnnotationConfigApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();
ctx.registerBean(UserService.class, () -> new UserService("admin"));
ctx.refresh();

UserService us = ctx.getBean(UserService.class);
```

* Creates bean on the fly at runtime.
* Useful for dynamic bean creation based on runtime configs.
* Skips classpath scanning, manual registration.
* λ-provided factory allows constructor args injection.
* Great in programmatic bootstrapping or plugin architectures.

### 🔚 Summary

`registerBean()` enables runtime registration of beans with optional supplier logic and constructor args, bypassing static configuration. It's ideal for dynamic needs like user-customized components or plugin-based modules.

```java
ctx.registerBean(UserService.class, () -> new UserService("admin"));
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A

**1. When use registerBean() vs annotations?**
When bean configuration must happen dynamically.

**2. Does registerBean support scopes?**
Yes, overloads allow scope and qualifier settings.

**3. Can it wire dependencies?**
Yes, supplier can `ctx.getBean(...)` inside.

---

## 5. Creating Beans using XML Configurations

### 🔍 Use-case example & explanations

```xml
<beans>
  <bean id="emailService" class="com.example.EmailService">
    <property name="host" value="smtp.example.com"/>
  </bean>
  <bean id="userNotifier" class="com.example.UserNotifier">
    <constructor-arg ref="emailService"/>
  </bean>
</beans>
```

* Old-school but still valid, especially for legacy projects.
* Explicit property & constructor injection.
* Clear separation from code, editable by ops teams.
* Allows profile-specific XML includes.
* Supports `import`, `alias`, `depends-on`, property placeholders.

### 🔚 Summary

XML bean definitions remain useful in legacy or ops-managed environments. They allow externalized, non-compiled configuration of beans, injection values, and wiring with `<bean>` and `<property>` elements.

```xml
<bean id="emailService" class="…"/>
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A

**1. Advantages of XML config?**
Language-agnostic, editable without recompilation.

**2. Can XML & annotations coexist?**
Yes—Spring merges both.

**3. How to enable bean profiling?**
Use `context:property-placeholder`, `<import resource="...-${profile}.xml"/>`.

---

## 6. Why Should We Use Frameworks?

### 🔍 Use-case example & explanations

* Avoid reinventing DI, AOP, MVC, transaction management.
* Increase developer productivity and consistency.
* Enforce design patterns and separation of concerns.
* Provide cross-cutting solutions like logging and caching.
* Standardize integration with third-party systems.

### 🔚 Summary

Frameworks like Spring abstract common boilerplate (DI, transactions, web MVC, AOP), speeding development, enforcing consistency, and enabling easier maintenance. They handle cross-cutting concerns, adapt to enterprise needs, and reduce bugs. Frameworks are the backbone of scalable, maintainable systems.

```java
@Service public class ReportService { … }
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A

**1. What’s a framework?**
A reusable software platform that standardizes common patterns and functionalities.

**2. Why use Spring over manual coding?**
Reduces boilerplate, improves testing, promotes modularity, integrates advanced features.

**3. Risks of frameworks?**
Potential overuse, complexity, learning curve—must ensure real benefit.

### 🔚 Summary

Spring Core offers the foundational DI container, lifecycle callbacks, and AOP integration. Spring Context extends configuration flexibility (profiles, events, SpEL). It’s the engine behind everything else in the ecosystem.

```java
@Value("${app.timeout}") int timeout;
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A

**1. What is BeanFactory?**
Basic DI container; ApplicationContext adds more enterprise services.

**2. When use AOP?**
Cross-cutting concerns like transaction management or logging.

**3. What is SpEL?**
An expression language to compute bean property values at runtime.

---

## 8. Introduction to Spring Projects – Part 2 (Spring Boot & Data)

### 🔍 Use-case example & explanations

* **Spring Boot**: opinionated auto-config, embedded servers.
* **Spring Data JPA**: repositories, CRUD, pagination, query methods.
* **Spring Web MVC / WebFlux**: REST web applications with controllers and templating.
* **Spring Security**: authentication, authorization.
* **Spring Cloud**: microservice components (config, discovery, circuit breaker).

### 🔚 Summary

Spring Boot streamlines app startup with auto‑configuration and embedded servers. Spring Data simplifies DB access with smart repositories. Web modules support REST, templating, and event-driven services. Security and Cloud fill enterprise requirements.

```java
@SpringBootApplication public class App { public static void main(...) {...} }
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A

**1. What is auto‑configuration?**
Spring Boot feature that configures beans based on classpath and properties.

**2. How does Spring Data JPA derive queries?**
It auto-generates SQL from method names like `findByEmail`.

**3. How to secure an endpoint?**
Use `@EnableWebSecurity` and configure with `HttpSecurity`.

---

## 9. Quiz: *Creating Beans inside Spring Context*

1. **True/False**: `@Component` and `@Service` both register a bean automatically.
   *Answer: True.*

2. **Fill in the blank:** Method annotated with `@Bean` must be inside a class annotated with `______`.
   *Answer: `@Configuration`.*

3. **Multiple Choice:** Which lifecycle method is run after dependency injection?

   * a) `destroy()`
   * b) `@PostConstruct`
   * c) `@PreDestroy`
     *Answer: b.*

---
The `@Autowired` annotation in Spring can be used to **inject dependencies** into:

1. **Fields**
2. **Constructors**
3. **Setter methods**
4. **Configuration methods (any method with parameters)**

### So, to answer your question:

There is **no hard limit** on the number of `@Autowired` injections you can have in a Spring application. You can inject as many dependencies as needed, in multiple places throughout your application.

However, here’s a breakdown:

---

### 1. **Field Injection**

```java
@Autowired
private MyService myService;

@Autowired
private AnotherService anotherService;
```

✅ You can inject multiple fields this way.

---

### 2. **Constructor Injection**

```java
@Autowired
public MyComponent(MyService myService, AnotherService anotherService) {
    this.myService = myService;
    this.anotherService = anotherService;
}
```

✅ Inject multiple dependencies via constructor (recommended for mandatory dependencies).

---

### 3. **Setter Injection**

```java
@Autowired
public void setMyService(MyService myService) {
    this.myService = myService;
}

@Autowired
public void setAnotherService(AnotherService anotherService) {
    this.anotherService = anotherService;
}
```

✅ Multiple setters can be autowired.

---

### 4. **Method Injection**

```java
@Autowired
public void configure(MyService myService, AnotherService anotherService) {
    // Use services
}
```

✅ Multiple dependencies in one method.

---

### Best Practices

* Prefer **constructor injection** for required dependencies.
* Avoid overusing field injection — it's harder to test.
* Avoid having too many dependencies — it may be a sign of a class doing too much (violating SRP - Single Responsibility Principle).

If you meant something else by “in how many `@Autowired` can be injected,” feel free to clarify!

## 10. Wiring Beans using `@Autowiring`

### 🔍 Use-case example & explanations

```java
@Service
public class InvoiceService {
  private final TaxCalculator taxCalculator;

  @Autowired
  public InvoiceService(TaxCalculator taxCalculator) {
    this.taxCalculator = taxCalculator;
  }
}
```

* Constructor injection preferred for immutability and testability.
* `@Autowired` can be used on constructor, setter, field.
* Supports optional injection (`required=false`).
* Use `@Qualifier` when multiple candidates.
* If there’s only one bean of type, `@Autowired` infers automatically.

### 🔚 Summary

`@Autowired` enables Spring to inject dependencies automatically. Constructor injection promotes immutability; setter/field injection offers flexibility. Use qualifiers for ambiguity, and optional flags for conditional wiring. DI enhances decoupling and testability.

```java
@Autowired public InvoiceService(TaxCalculator tc) { … }
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A

**1. Why prefer constructor injection?**
Makes dependencies explicit and the bean immutable.

**2. How to handle multiple beans of same type?**
Use `@Qualifier("beanName")`.

**3. What if a dependency is missing?**
Spring throws a `NoSuchBeanDefinitionException`.

---

## 11. Introduction to Wiring & Autowiring inside Spring

### 🔍 Use-case example & explanations

* **Manual wiring**: use `@Bean` or XML `<bean ref="..."/>`.
* **Annotation-based**: `@Component`, `@Autowired`, `@Qualifier`.
* **Java config**: central `@Configuration` + `@Bean` orchestration.
* **ByType vs ByName**: field-type matching vs named-bean injection.
* **Advanced**: `@Primary`, `@Resource`, `@Inject` support.

### 🔚 Summary

Spring wiring links bean dependencies within the container. It can be manual, annotation-based, or programmatic. `@Autowired` handles by-type, `@Qualifier` by-name. Java-config and XML offer explicit control; annotations streamline typical use. Proper wiring ensures robust, maintainable systems.

```java
@Autowired InvoiceService invoiceService;
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A

**1. Difference between byType and byName?**
ByType matches bean types; byName uses bean id or qualifier.

**2. What is @Primary used for?**
Defines default bean when multiple candidates exist.

**3. Can you combine XML and annotation wiring?**
Yes—Spring merges both configuration mechanisms.

---

Here are detailed breakdowns, each with a real-world coding example, bullet-point explanations, a summary with code, and 3 interview Q\&A. Let's go!

---

## 1. **Comparison between `@Bean` vs `@Component`**

### ✅ Use-case & Example:

Imagine you have a third-party `EmailService` you can’t modify but need as a Spring bean.

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
  @Bean
  public EmailService emailService() {
    return new EmailService("smtp.example.com");
  }
}

@Component
public class NotificationManager {
  private final EmailService emailService;

  public NotificationManager(EmailService emailService) {
    this.emailService = emailService;
  }

  public void send(String msg) {
    emailService.send(msg);
  }
}
```

### 🌟 Explanations:

* `@Component` applies classpath scanning; auto-detects, and auto-instantiates.
* `@Bean` is for manual bean creation in `@Configuration` classes.
* Use `@Bean` when you need customization or can’t modify the class.
* `@Component` is concise and great for your own classes.
* Both get registered in the Spring context and support DI and lifecycle callbacks.

### 📝 Summary (5 lines):

1. Use `@Component` for your own class auto-scanning.
2. Use `@Bean` for third-party/custom instantiation logic.
3. Both register beans and support injection.
4. `@Bean` sits in `@Configuration` and allows parameter/config overrides.
5. `@Component` is annotation-driven—less plumbing, more automatic.

```java
// summary code snippet:
@Configuration
class Config {
  @Bean EmailService es() { return new EmailService("host"); }
}
@Component
class C { C(EmailService es){} }
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q**: Can both be used together?
   **A**: Yes. `@Bean` for custom wiring, `@Component` for scanning your own classes.
2. **Q**: Why might you choose `@Bean` over `@Component`?
   **A**: You need control over instantiation, constructor args, or third-party objects.
3. **Q**: Does `@Component` allow constructor args?
   **A**: Yes, via DI—Spring resolves dependencies automatically.

---

## 2. **Understanding `@PostConstruct`**

### ✅ Use-case & Example:

You need to setup a file reader after bean creation.

```java
@Component
public class CsvLoader {
  private BufferedReader reader;
  private final String path = "/data/users.csv";

  @PostConstruct
  public void init() throws IOException {
    reader = Files.newBufferedReader(Paths.get(path));
  }
}
```

### 🌟 Explanations:

* Executes after DI and before bean is ready to be used.
* Useful for resource initialization, e.g., DB connections, file loading.
* Must be `public void noArgs`, and run once.
* Managed by container: works for `@Component`, `@Bean`, etc.
* Fails startup if exception thrown—good for early failure detection.

### 📝 Summary (5 lines):

1. Runs after bean instantiation + DI.
2. Ideal for initialization tasks (DB, file, etc.).
3. Annotated methods are auto-discovered and executed.
4. Can throw exceptions—fail fast.
5. Integrates with Spring lifecycle seamlessly.

```java
@PostConstruct
public void init() { /* setup here */ }
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q**: What’s difference between `@PostConstruct` and `InitializingBean`?
   **A**: `@PostConstruct` is annotation-based, not tied to Spring interface.
2. **Q**: Can @PostConstruct be private?
   **A**: No—must be `public void noArgs`.
3. **Q**: What happens if the method throws an exception?
   **A**: Spring context fails to start (startup error).

---

## 3. **Understanding `@PreDestroy`**

### ✅ Use-case & Example:

Closing resources like sockets or file streams gracefully.

```java
@Component
public class CacheManager {
  private final DataSource ds;

  public CacheManager(DataSource ds) {
    this.ds = ds;
  }

  @PreDestroy
  public void cleanup() throws SQLException {
    ds.getConnection().close();
  }
}
```

### 🌟 Explanations:

* Called before bean is removed/shutdown.
* Perfect for releasing resources, closing connections.
* Must be `public void noArgs` and executes once.
* Only works if Spring context is shutdown orderly (not killed).
* Helps avoid memory leaks and resource locks.

### 📝 Summary (5 lines):

1. Called on container shutdown for cleanup tasks.
2. Use for file handles, connections, threads, etc.
3. Annotated on `public void noArgs` method.
4. Executes during graceful shutdown.
5. Helps ensure resource integrity and no leaks.

```java
@PreDestroy
public void cleanup() { /* release resources here */ }
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q**: Can resource cleanup occur without `@PreDestroy`?
   **A**: Yes—but less declaratively. Could rely on `shutdownHook`.
2. **Q**: Can you rely on `@PreDestroy` during JVM kill?
   **A**: No—it won’t execute on abrupt kills.
3. **Q**: Multiple `@PreDestroy` methods?
   **A**: Allowed, execution order unspecified—prefer single method.

---

## 4. **Creating Beans programmatically using `registerBean()`**

### ✅ Use-case & Example:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class DynamicApp implements ApplicationContextAware {
  private GenericApplicationContext ctx;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(DynamicApp.class, args);
  }

  @Override
  public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext ac) {
    this.ctx = (GenericApplicationContext) ac;
    ctx.registerBean(
      "dynamicService", DynamicService.class,
      () -> new DynamicService("runtime-param")
    );
  }
}

class DynamicService {
  public DynamicService(String param) { /* ... */ }
}
```

### 🌟 Explanations:

* Useful when bean creation depends on runtime data.
* Avoids static config—flexible injection based on logic.
* Takes name, class, and `Supplier` callback.
* Works before injections so others can @Autowired it.
* Could also replace existing bean with new instance.

### 📝 Summary (5 lines):

1. Use in `ApplicationContextAware` for runtime bean creation.
2. Accepts class type and supplier factory.
3. Supports dynamic constructor logic.
4. Beans available for DI after registration.

public class XmlApp {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");
    XmlService svc = ctx.getBean("xmlService", XmlService.class);
  }
}
```

### 🌟 Explanations:

* Traditional way via `<bean>` definitions.
* Good for legacy applications.
* Supports property, constructor args, lifecycle, scope.
* Explicit wiring—easy to visualize.
* Can coexist with annotation-based config.

### 📝 Summary (5 lines):

1. `<bean>` tags define id, class, scope, args.
2. Good for migration or externalized config.
3. Supports DI, lifecycle hooks, scopes.
4. Explicit bean definitions—a visual map.

---

## 10. **Wiring Beans using `@Autowiring`**

### ✅ Use-case & Example:

Inject `PaymentService` into `OrderManager`.

```java
@Component
public class OrderManager {
  @Autowired
  private PaymentService paymentService;

  public void place(Order o) {
    paymentService.process(o);
  }
}
```

### 🌟 Explanations:

* `@Autowired` on fields, setters, or constructors.
* Constructor injection is best practice (immutability + testability).
* Supports type-based matching, qualifier, and optional injection.
* Works within component-scanned, bean-created context.
* Throws if multiple candidates—resolve with `@Qualifier`.

### 📝 Summary (5 lines):

1. `@Autowired` injects dependencies by type.
2. Prefer constructor injection—clear, safe.
3. Supports qualifiers for ambiguity.
4. Can mark dependencies optional.

  }
}
```

### 🌟 Explanations:

* `@ComponentScan` picks up classes annotated with `@Component`.
* `@Bean` can depend on other beans via method parameters.
* `@Autowired` resolves dependencies into classes.
* Wiring = connecting beans; auto-wiring is automatic DI.
* Works through setter, constructor, field.

### 📝 Summary (5 lines):

1. `@ComponentScan` discovers annotated beans.
2. `@Bean` allows explicit, controlled wiring.
3. Method parameters of `@Bean` are auto-injected.
4. `@Autowired` populates dependencies in components.
5. Together they form Spring's wiring / auto-wiring mechanism.

```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(...)
class Cfg {
  @Bean Svc svc(Repo r) { return new Svc(r); }
}
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q**: Difference between wiring and auto-wiring?
   **A**: Wiring explicit in config; auto-wiring automatic by type.
2. **Q**: How does Spring find beans?
   **A**: Via classpath scanning, `@Bean`, XML, or programmatic registration.
3. **Q**: Can auto-wiring pick ambiguous types?
   **A**: Only if resolved by qualifier or bean name.

---

Here’s a structured breakdown of key Spring dependency‑injection techniques, circular‑dependency theory and resolution, interview‑style questions, plus a sample assignment.

---

## 1. Wiring Beans using method‑call (i.e. manual call in configuration)

**Use‑case**: simple JavaConfig with explicit bean creation via calling factory methods.

* You define beans in a `@Configuration` class; one bean method calls another method to obtain a dependency.
* Spring treats each bean method as a singleton unless otherwise scoped.
* Enables full control but more verbose than annotation‐driven wiring.
* Useful when migrating legacy code from XML.
* Dependency is explicit and static.

**Summary**: JavaConfig method‑call wiring lets one `@Bean` method invoke another to inject dependencies, providing explicit wiring without annotations. It’s verbose but clear.
**Code**:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
  @Bean
  public ServiceA serviceA() {
    return new ServiceA(serviceB());
  }
  @Bean
  public ServiceB serviceB() {
    return new ServiceB();
  }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: What happens if you call `serviceB()` twice in config?
   **A**: Spring returns same singleton instance (CGLIB proxies bean methods), so no duplication.
2. **Q**: When would you use method‑call wiring?
   **A**: In legacy migration, explicit wiring, or for beans where annotation scanning isn’t feasible.
3. **Q**: Is order of methods relevant?
   **A**: Not strictly—Spring resolves dependencies and creates target beans before calling.

---

## 2. Wiring Beans using method‑parameters (JavaConfig)

**Use‑case**: cleaner JavaConfig where Spring injects parameters rather than manual calls.

* In `@Configuration`, define a `@Bean` method with parameters of other beans.
* Spring resolves parameters by type and invokes methods in correct order.
* Cleaner than method‑call wiring.
* Maintains singleton scope.
* Dependencies easily testable.

**Summary**: Method‑parameter wiring uses JavaConfig bean method parameters to inject dependencies automatically; it’s clean and declarative.
**Code**:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
  @Bean ServiceB serviceB() { return new ServiceB(); }
  @Bean ServiceA serviceA(ServiceB b) { return new ServiceA(b); }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: Is parameter naming important?
   **A**: Spring matches by type; names matter only if ambiguity exists.
2. **Q**: How does this differ from constructor injection in components?
   **A**: It’s at config time; components still need annotations.
3. **Q**: Can you inject prototype scoped beans via method‑parameters?
   **A**: Yes, but method method returns are singleton; use lookup otherwise.

---

## 3. Wiring Beans using @Autowired on class fields

**Use‑case**: quick injection without constructor or setter boilerplate.

* Annotate private fields with `@Autowired`.
* Spring uses reflection to inject dependencies.
* Simplest syntax but hides dependencies.
* Makes unit testing and immutability harder ([Java Tech Blog][1], [CodingEasyPeasy][2], [Reddit][3]).
* Can help resolve circular dependencies if other styles fail ([CodingEasyPeasy][2]).

**Summary**: Field injection is terse but conceals class dependencies, harms testability, and is generally discouraged in favor of constructor-based injection.
**Code**:

```java
@Component
public class Car {
  @Autowired private Engine engine;
  public void drive() { engine.start(); }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: Why is field injection discouraged?
   **A**: Dependencies aren’t explicit; hard to test; breaks immutability ([Reddit][4]).
2. **Q**: Can you inject optional dependencies via field injection?
   **A**: Yes via `@Autowired(required=false)` but requires null checks.
3. **Q**: Does Spring use setter injection if no setter exists?
   **A**: For field injection Spring still injects by reflection; setter injection not used.

---

## 4. Wiring Beans using @Autowired on setter method

**Use‑case**: optional or mutable dependencies, or those requiring post‑initialization handling.

* Use setter methods with `@Autowired`.
* Spring calls constructor first, then injects dependencies via setter.
* Allows null-checks and dynamic changes at runtime.
* Often used to break circular dependencies ([Baeldung][5], [GeeksforGeeks][6]).
* Slightly less recommended than constructor injection for mandatory dependencies.

**Summary**: Setter injection places dependencies after bean instantiation, allowing mutability and optional wiring; it's useful for circular dependency resolution.
**Code**:

```java
@Component
public class ServiceA {
  private ServiceB b;
  @Autowired
  public void setServiceB(ServiceB b) { this.b = b; }
  public void doA() { b.doB(); }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: When would setter injection be preferable to constructor injection?
   **A**: For optional dependencies, or to break circular dependencies.
2. **Q**: What is a downside?
   **A**: Bean is mutable; possible null-pointer use if setter not called.
3. **Q**: How does Spring detect setter injection?
   **A**: The presence of `@Autowired` on a setter informs Spring to inject.

---

\## 5. Wiring Beans using @Autowired on constructor
**Use‑case**: recommended style for mandatory dependencies, immutability, and clarity.

* Annotate constructor (or omit if single constructor since Spring 4.3).
* Dependencies are final, explicit, and required.
* Supports testability and immutability.
* Prevents circular dependencies at compile-time.
* Preferred by Spring docs and community ([Reddit][7], [Reddit][3], [Reddit][8]).

**Summary**: Constructor injection is the preferred Spring wiring method: explicit, immutable, testable, and safe from runtime surprises.
**Code**:

```java
@Component
public class Engine { /*...*/ }
@Component
public class Car {
  private final Engine engine;
  @Autowired
  public Car(Engine engine) { this.engine = engine; }
  public void drive() { engine.start(); }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: Do you need `@Autowired` if only one constructor is defined?
   **A**: No—Spring auto-wires a single constructor since 4.3 .
2. **Q**: Can constructor injection contribute to circular dependency?
   **A**: Yes—it makes cycles impossible at runtime, triggering immediate error.
3. **Q**: How does constructor injection aid unit testing?
   **A**: You can instantiate class directly with mocks without Spring.

---

## 6. Deep dive of Autowiring inside Spring – Theory

* Autowiring resolves bean dependencies by type (default), possibly by name.
* Modes include `no`, `byName`, `byType`, `constructor` in XML.
* Annotation-based: `@Autowired` supports by type; ambiguous beans need `@Primary` or `@Qualifier` ([Java Tech Blog][1], [Home][9], [Home][10]).
* Simple scalar properties are not autowirable.
* Constructor > setter > field in priority and practice.
* Autowiring is overridden by explicit configuration.

**Summary**: Spring autowiring simplifies bean resolution by type/name but has pitfalls such as ambiguity, hidden dependencies, and limitations on simple types. Use qualifiers or explicit wiring when needed.
**Code**: N/A (theoretical).

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: Why can’t you autowire `String` properties?
   **A**: Spring doesn't resolve simple/primitive or String types via autowiring.
2. **Q**: How do you resolve multiple candidates?
   **A**: Use `@Qualifier` or mark one bean `@Primary`.
3. **Q**: Does XML autowiring support field injection?
   **A**: No—XML supports only constructor or setter.

---

## 7. Deep dive of Autowiring inside Spring – Coding example

**Use‑case**: demonstrating field/setter/constructor with qualifiers and how Spring picks.

* Define two beans implementing same interface.
* Autowire by type → ambiguity → qualifier.
* Show constructor vs setter vs field.

**Summary**: Example demonstrates autowiring behavior, ambiguity resolution via `@Qualifier` or `@Primary`, and differences in injection methods.

**Code**:

```java
@Component interface Engine {}
@Component @Primary class V8Engine implements Engine {}
@Component @Qualifier("v6") class V6Engine implements Engine {}
@Component class Car {
  private final Engine engine;
  @Autowired
  public Car(Engine engine) { this.engine = engine; }
}
```

---

## 8. Understanding and Avoiding Circular dependencies

**Theory & practice**:

* Circular dependency occurs when A depends on B and B depends back on A—Spring throws `BeanCurrentlyInCreationException` for constructors ([Java Code Geeks][11], [Home][10], [Reddit][12], [smartprogramming.in][13], [GeeksforGeeks][6]).
* Setter or field injection can sometimes resolve cycles .
* Use `@Lazy` to defer creation and break the cycle ([Baeldung][5]).
* Better: redesign to remove the cycle via interfaces or service refactoring.
* Other tools: `@PostConstruct`, `ApplicationContextAware` to wire manually ([Baeldung][5]).

**Summary**: Spring circular dependencies must be avoided. Constructor injection fails; setter/field injection or `@Lazy` can break the cycle. Best solution: refactor design.

**Code**:

```java
@Component class A {
  private B b;
  @Autowired public void setB(@Lazy B b) { this.b = b; }
}
@Component class B {
  private A a;
  @Autowired public void setA(@Lazy A a) { this.a = a; }
}
```

---

## 9. Problem Statement for Assignment

**Problem**: Create a small Spring Boot app with three services (`ServiceX`, `ServiceY`, `ServiceZ`) where `ServiceX` depends on `Y` and `Z`, `Y` depends on `Z`, and `Z` on `X`. Demonstrate detection and resolution of circular dependencies using different wiring styles, qualifiers, bean scopes, and lazy injection.

---

## 10. Solution for Assignment

**Outline**:

* Show failure with constructor injection causing `BeanCurrentlyInCreationException`.
* Resolve using setter injection + `@Lazy` on one dependency.
* Use `@Qualifier` if multiple bean candidates.
* Demonstrate prototype bean injected into singleton via `@Lookup`.
* Provide unit tests.

---

## 11. “Wiring Beans using @Autowiring” Quiz

1. Which type of injection makes dependencies immutable?

   * A: Constructor injection
2. How to resolve ambiguity with two beans of same type?

   * A: `@Qualifier` or `@Primary`
3. Can you autowire String property?

   * A: No

---

## 12. Beans scope inside Spring framework

* **Singleton**: Default; one instance per Spring context.
* **Prototype**: New instance each time requested.
* **Request**, **Session**, **Application**, **Websocket**: web-aware scopes.
* Injector into singleton from prototype leads to single prototype reused unless you use `@Lookup` or ObjectFactory/Provider.
* Use prototype for stateful, singleton for stateless services ([Baeldung][5], [Java Tech Blog][1], [Reddit][7], [Reddit][14]).

---

Sure! Let’s dive into each topic with real-time use cases, coding examples, explanations, summary, and interview Q\&As. Given the volume, I’ll cover each concisely but comprehensively.

---

## 1. Introduction to Bean Scopes inside Spring 😊

**Use‑case**: Choosing bean lifetimes in web apps:

* **Singleton**: one instance – e.g. `UserService`.
* **Prototype**: new per request – e.g. stateful `ReportGenerator`.
* **Request**: one per HTTP request.
* **Session**: one per HTTP session.
* **Application**: one per ServletContext.

**5 bullet point explanations**:

* Spring supports 5 built-in bean scopes.
* Default is **singleton**.
* Prototype beans: new on each `getBean()`.
* Web-aware scopes (`request`, `session`, `application`) require `WebApplicationContext`.
* Proper scope reduces memory/faults in concurrent scenarios.

**5-line summary**
In Spring, bean scopes define lifecycle and visibility. Singleton beans are created once per IoC container. Prototype beans yield a new instance upon each injection request. Web scopes (request, session, application) tie bean life to HTTP lifecycle. Choosing the right scope prevents state issues and improves application performance.

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
  @Bean @Scope("singleton") public UserService userService(){ return new UserService(); }
  @Bean @Scope("prototype") public ReportGenerator reportGenerator(){ return new ReportGenerator(); }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. *Q: What’s the default bean scope?*
   *A: Singleton—one instance per container.*
2. *Q: When would you use prototype scope?*
   *A: For stateful beans needing fresh instances per use.*
3. *Q: Difference between session and request scopes?*
   *A: Request lives for one HTTP request; session lasts the user’s session.*

---

## 2. Deep‑dive on Singleton Bean scope

**Use‑case**: Shared stateless services like `EmailSender`.

**5 bullet points**:

* **Lazy/Eager**: instantiated at container startup or on first use.
* Stateless✔️ – concurrency safe by design.
* Shared across threads – avoid mutable state.
* Memory efficient – single instance.
* Beware with non-thread‑safe resources.

**5‑line summary**
Singleton is the default scope in Spring. It ensures a single shared instance per container. Ideal for stateless service beans. Can be eagerly or lazily loaded. Must avoid mutable shared state to prevent threading issues.

```java
@Component
public class EmailService {
  public void send(String to, String msg){ /*send mail*/ }
}
```

**Q\&A**:

1. *Q: When is a singleton bean created?*
   *A: By default on container startup unless marked lazy.*
2. *Q: Are singleton beans thread‑safe?*
   *A: They must be stateless or handle concurrency manually.*
3. *Q: How to enforce thread-safety in singleton?*
   *A: Use immutable fields, local variables, or synchronization.*

---

## 3. What is a Race Condition

**Use‑case**: Two threads updating a shared counter simultaneously → corrupted result.

**5 bullet points**:

* Occurs when threads share mutable state without synchronization.
* Timing-dependent – non-deterministic bugs.
* Common in multithreading scenarios.
* Prevent with locks, `synchronized`, or atomic types.
* Hard to reproduce.

**5‑line summary**
A race condition occurs when two threads access and modify shared data simultaneously without proper synchronization, leading to unpredictable results. It's timing-dependent and non-deterministic. The usual counterexample is incrementing a shared variable. Solutions include `synchronized`, `Lock`, `AtomicInteger`, or avoiding shared mutable state.

```java
@Service
public class CounterService {
  private int counter = 0;
  public void increment(){ counter++; }
  public int get() { return counter; }
}
```

**Q\&A**:

1. *Q: How to fix race conditions in Java?*
   *A: Use `synchronized`, `Lock`, `AtomicInteger`, etc.*
2. *Q: Differences between `synchronized` and `Lock`?*
   *A: `Lock` supports try-lock, fairness, manual unlocking.*
3. *Q: What’s atomic class?*
   *A: Thread‑safe classes like `AtomicInteger` using CAS.*

---

## 4. Use cases of Singleton Bean scope

**Use‑case**: Logging, caching, service facades.

**5 bullet points**:

* Caching beans to hold common data.
* Service facades stateless across requests.
* Utility classes e.g. `EmailService`, `JwtTokenUtil`.
* Shared resources like `ObjectMapper`.
* Singleton DB access pools, if thread-safe.

**5‑line summary**
Singleton beans are excellent for stateless services, caching, shared utility instances, and resource pools. They minimize memory footprint and initialization cost. They must avoid shared mutable state. They can be eagerly or lazily loaded based on startup needs.

```java
@Component
public class CacheService {
  private Map<String,String> cache = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
  public String get(String key){ return cache.get(key); }
}
```

**Q\&A**:

1. *Q: Why prefer singleton for caching?*
   *A: Data shared across the app, faster access, lower overhead.*
2. *Q: Can singleton hold user-specific state?*
   *A: No—must remain stateless or risk data leakage.*
3. *Q: How to configure a bean as singleton?*
   *A: Default; explicitly using `@Scope("singleton")`.*

---

## 5. Deep‑dive of Eager and Lazy instantiation of Singleton scope

**Use‑case**: Large startup time vs memory usage tradeoffs.

**5 bullet points**:

* Eager: created at container init.
* Lazy: created on first request.
* `@Lazy`: annotation on bean or config class.
* Spring Boot supports lazy initialization globally.
* Affects startup time, memory usage.

**5‑line summary**
Spring singletons can be eagerly or lazily instantiated. Eager beans initialize at container startup; lazy ones only when first needed. Lazy saves startup time and memory but delays failure detection. Both support `@Lazy` or global config via `spring.main.lazy-initialization=true`.

```java
@Configuration
public class Config {
  @Bean @Lazy
  public HeavyService heavyService(){ return new HeavyService(); }
}
```

**Q\&A**:

1. *Q: Pros of eager vs lazy?*
   *A: Eager fails early; lazy saves startup time.*
2. *Q: How to enable lazy globally in Spring Boot?*
   *A: `spring.main.lazy-initialization=true`.*
3. *Q: Can you mix lazy and eager?*
   *A: Yes—annotate individual beans with `@Lazy` or omit for eager.*

---

Great! Let’s continue in the same format for the remaining topics:

---

## 6. Demo of Eager and Lazy Instantiation of Singleton Bean

**Use‑case**: Logging startup behavior differences.

**5 bullet points**:

* Use `@Lazy` on a `@Component` to delay its creation.
* Log in constructors to observe instantiation timing.
* Access bean in `main()` to trigger lazy init.
* Without access, lazy bean never gets created.
* Useful to verify configuration.

**5-line summary**
Implement two beans—one eager (default) and one marked with `@Lazy`. Use log statements in their constructors to inspect when they’re loaded. Running the application without accessing the lazy bean shows only the eager one initializes. Accessing it later triggers its creation. This demo helps illustrate the instantiation mechanism clearly.

```java
@Component public class EagerBean {
  public EagerBean() { System.out.println("EagerBean created"); }
}

@Component @Lazy public class LazyBean {
  public LazyBean() { System.out.println("LazyBean created"); }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
  AnnotationConfigApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
  System.out.println("Context initialized");
  ctx.getBean(LazyBean.class);  // triggers lazy creation
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: What happens if you never request a lazy bean?
   **A**: It never gets instantiated.
2. **Q**: How to verify when beans are created?
   **A**: Log or debug in bean constructor or `@PostConstruct`.
3. **Q**: Can `@Lazy` apply to prototypes?
   **A**: Yes, but prototype is always lazy by nature.

---

## 7. Eager Initialization vs Lazy Initialization

**Use‑case**: Tuning startup time and resource usage.

**5 bullet points**:

* Eager: startup time includes all beans instantiation.
* Lazy: spreads cost; some beans may never be instantiated.
* Eager helps discover config errors early.
* Lazy saves memory for unused beans.
* Trade-off depends on application scale and critical components.

**5-line summary**
Eager initialization builds all singleton beans at startup, ensuring immediate availability and early failure detection, but increases startup time. Lazy initialization defers bean creation until needed, improving startup latency and memory usage but might delay failures and runtime performance. Choose strategy based on deployment speed vs. run-time reliability trade-offs.

```java
spring.main.lazy-initialization=true  // in application.properties
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Which cases prefer eager init?
   **A**: When most beans are always needed and early validation matters.
2. **Q**: Trade-offs of lazy init?
   **A**: Faster startup vs. delayed failure detection.
3. **Q**: How to apply lazy init to single bean?
   **A**: Annotate with `@Lazy`, either on class or injection point.

---

## 8. Deep‑dive of Prototype Bean Scope

**Use‑case**: `ReportGenerator` needing fresh state per use.

**5 bullet points**:

* Prototype beans produce new instance per `getBean()`.
* Spring doesn’t manage full lifecycle beyond creation.
* No de‑allocation hooks—`destroy()` not auto-called.
* Can inject prototype into singleton via `@Lookup`.
* Useful for stateful or resource-intensive beans.

**5-line summary**
Prototype scope gives a fresh bean instance on each call to `getBean()`. Spring initializes it but doesn’t manage complete lifecycle. Destruction logic must be handled manually. Useful for stateful, short-lived components, like per-request form handlers or document generators. For use inside singletons, use lookup methods or `ObjectProvider`.

```java
@Component @Scope("prototype")
public class ReportGenerator {
  private int vol = new Random().nextInt();
  public int getVol() { return vol; }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: When is prototype bean destroyed?
   **A**: Never automatically—bean user must handle cleanup.
2. **Q**: How to inject prototype into singleton?
   **A**: Use `@Lookup`, `ObjectFactory`, or `ApplicationContext.getBean(...)`.
3. **Q**: Why not use prototype for all?
   **A**: More overhead and no lifecycle management; potentially high memory usage.

---

## 9. Singleton Beans vs Prototype Beans

**Use‑case**: Comparing shared vs transient bean behavior.

**5 bullet points**:

* Singleton: one shared instance, prototype: new per request.
* Singleton suitable for stateless, thread-safe beans.
* Prototype used for stateful, non-shared data models.
* Lifecycle fully managed only for singleton.
* Injection differs—prototype needs lookup to enforce new instance.

**5-line summary**
Singleton beans are shared singletons with full lifecycle management and are default. Prototype beans create new instances each injection call but lack lifecycle callbacks beyond initialization. Choose singleton for shared, stateless services; choose prototype for stateful per-use components. Prototype injection into singleton requires special handling.

```java
@Component public class Client {
  @Autowired ApplicationContext ctx;
  public void run() {
    ReportGenerator r1 = ctx.getBean(ReportGenerator.class);
    ReportGenerator r2 = ctx.getBean(ReportGenerator.class);
    assert r1 != r2;
  }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Can prototype bean be injected into singleton directly?
   **A**: Yes, but one instance on context creation—use `@Lookup` or `Provider`.
2. **Q**: Which scope is default?
   **A**: Singleton.
3. **Q**: Prototype lifecycle callbacks?
   **A**: Only `@PostConstruct` runs; no `@PreDestroy`.

## 10. "Beans scope inside Spring framework" Quiz

**5 bullet points**:

* Quiz tests knowledge of 5 core scopes.
* Include scenario-based questions.
* Provide answers and explanations.
* Reinforces distinctions between singleton and prototype.
* Clarifies web-specific scopes.

**5-line summary**
A quiz ensures understanding of Spring’s bean scopes: singleton, prototype, request, session, application. It helps reinforce correct usage by asking scenario-based questions—like choosing a scope for per-user session data—and ensuring clear rationale for each answer. Answers include concise justifications.

```text
1. Default scope? – Singleton (shared).  
2. Scope for each HTTP request? – Request  
3. New on each injection? – Prototype  
... etc.
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Which scope binds to ServletContext?
   **A**: Application.
2. **Q**: Scope for user login data?
   **A**: Session.
3. **Q**: Prototype vs. Request difference?
   **A**: Prototype-from container always; request tied to HTTP layer.

---

## 11. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) inside Spring framework

**Use‑case**: Logging, transaction management, security checks.

**5 bullet points**:

* Cross-cutting concerns separated from business code.
* Uses proxies: JDK/CGlib.
* Key terms: advice, pointcut, aspect, join point, weaving.
* Supports before/after/around/etc advices.
* Configured via `@Aspect` and `@EnableAspectJAutoProxy`.

**5-line summary**
Spring AOP modularizes cross-cutting concerns like logging, transactions, and security. Aspects contain advices defining behavior at join points matched by pointcuts. Spring uses dynamic proxies or CGlib to weave aspects at runtime. Configuration is simplified through annotations and XML. This improves code maintainability and separation of concerns.

```java
@Aspect @Component public class LoggingAspect {
  @Pointcut("execution(* com.app.service.*.*(..))")
  void serviceMethods(){}

  @Before("serviceMethods()")
  public void logBefore(JoinPoint jp){
    System.out.println("Invoking: " + jp.getSignature());
  }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Differences between Aspect and Advice?
   **A**: Aspect is the module; advice is the action at a join point.
2. **Q**: How does Spring apply AOP?
   **A**: Runtime proxies weaving aspects into bean method calls.
3. **Q**: Types of advice available?
   **A**: `@Before`, `@After`, `@AfterReturning`, `@AfterThrowing`, `@Around`.

---

## 12. Introduction to Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)

**Use‑case**: Global exception handling across services.

**5 bullet points**:

* AOP separates concerns like logging & security.
* Enhances modularity of code.
* Advice executes at join points like method execution.
* Pointcuts define where advices apply.
* Aspects bundle pointcuts and advices into reusable modules.

**5-line summary**
AOP provides a powerful way to encapsulate cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security) into reusable modules (aspects). It defines where code should apply (`pointcut`) and what code runs (`advice`) at those points (`join points`). This leads to cleaner, more maintainable code by decoupling secondary concerns from business logic. Spring supports AOP with annotations and uses proxy-based weaving.

```java
@Aspect @Component public class ExceptionAspect {
  @AfterThrowing(pointcut="execution(* com.app.*.*(..))", throwing="ex")
  public void logError(Exception ex){ System.out.println("Error: " + ex); }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: What’s a join point?
   **A**: A point during execution of a program, like method execution.
2. **Q**: What’s a pointcut?
   **A**: Expression that selects join points for advice application.
3. **Q**: Difference between `@Around` and `@Before`?
   **A**: `@Around` controls invocation; `@Before` runs before execution only.

---

## 13. Understanding Problems in Web Applications Without AOP

**Use‑case**: Logging repeated across controllers.

**5 bullet points**:

* Repetitive logging across many services.
* Scattered security checks.
* Hard to maintain exception handling.
* Duplication leads to inconsistent behavior.
* Tightly coupled concerns making code brittle.

**5-line summary**
Without AOP, cross-cutting concerns in web apps—like logging, transactions, and security—are scattered and repeated across layers. This leads to code duplication, inconsistency, and maintenance headaches. There's no centralized way to enforce behavior across multiple classes, resulting in tightly coupled, brittle code structures.

```java
public class UserController {
  public User get(int id){
    System.out.println("Entering get()");
    try {
      return userService.get(id);
    } finally {
      System.out.println("Exiting get()");
    }
  }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Risks of repetitive logging?
   **A**: Bugs, divergence, poor maintainability.
2. **Q**: Tightly coupled code consequences?
   **A**: Harder to refactor and update cross-cutting concerns.
3. **Q**: How AOP addresses these issues?
   **A**: Centralizes behavior via aspects, reducing duplication.

---

## 14. Understanding & Running Application Without AOP

**Use‑case**: Plain service calls lacking cross-cutting logic.

**5 bullet points**:

* No proxy weaving—plain method invocation.
* No advice runs—methods unaware of logging/security.
* Hard-coded duplication across classes.
* Difficult tracking of cross-cutting behavior.
* Inefficient for large or evolving applications.

**5-line summary**
Running without AOP means services and controllers lack unified behavior for logging, security, or transactions. Each class must reimplement these concerns, leading to duplication and inconsistency. Performance is inefficient, and maintainability is low. AOP eliminates these issues by decoupling cross-cutting logic from core business code.

---

Sure! Let’s go through each topic with:

* 5 bullet‑point explanations with **real‑time use‑case coding snippet**
* A 5‑line plain‑English summary
* Code at the end of that summary
* Then 3 interview Q\&A on each topic

---

## 1. AOP Jargons

**Explanations + use case**

* **Aspect**: A modular unit encapsulating cross‑cutting concern (e.g. logging).
* **Join point**: Well‑defined points in execution (e.g. method call).
* **Pointcut**: Expression selecting join points (e.g. all service methods).
* **Advice**: Action taken at a join point (e.g. before/after).
* **Weaving**: Injecting aspects into target code at runtime using proxy.

Use case: logging every service call.

**Summary (5 lines)**
AOP introduces terms to structure cross‑cutting concerns: an *Aspect* defines behavior, *Advice* is the code to run at selected *Join points*, and *Pointcuts* choose which join‑points. *Weaving* is the process that links aspects into existing classes. In Spring AOP, weaving happens at runtime using proxies. Developers can define advice types such as `@Before`, `@After`, `@Around`. This allows centralized logic (e.g., logging) outside individual business code.

**Code snippet**

```java
@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {
    @Pointcut("execution(* com.myapp.service.*.*(..))")
    public void serviceMethods() {}
    @Before("serviceMethods()")
    public void logBefore(JoinPoint jp) {
        System.out.println("Entering "+ jp.getSignature());
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. *What is a join point in Spring AOP?*
   A join point is a specific point in execution, like method invocation or exception handling, where advice can be applied.

2. *How does Spring implement weaving?*
   It uses runtime proxies—JDK dynamic proxies or CGLIB—to weave in aspects at bean creation time.

3. *Why use pointcut expressions?*
   They allow fine-grained selection of join points, enabling advice to apply only to targeted methods or classes.

---

## 2. Weaving inside AOP

**Explanations + use case**

* **Compile-time weaving**: Aspects woven during build (e.g. AspectJ compiler).
* **Load-time weaving (LTW)**: Aspects applied when classes are loaded.
* **Runtime weaving**: Spring AOP uses proxies at runtime.
* **Proxy‑based weaving**: Only applies to Spring beans, interface or subclass based.
* **Transparent to business code**: No modifications in application code.

Use case: apply transaction management to services without modifying service classes.

**Summary (5 lines)**
Weaving is the process that injects aspects into application code. Spring AOP uses runtime proxy weaving: it creates proxies for beans and intercepts method calls. There’s no byte‑code manipulation and it works only on Spring‑managed beans. Unlike compile‑time or LTW weaving, it’s simpler and immediate. This is transparent—your business classes remain clean.

```java
// same LoggingAspect from before, weaving happens when Spring instantiates bean
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. *What’s the difference between Spring AOP and AspectJ weaving?*
   Spring uses runtime proxy weaving; AspectJ supports compile‑time and load‑time weaving and byte‑code weaving.

2. *Can Spring AOP intercept non‑Spring managed classes?*
   No, only Spring beans managed by the application context can be proxied.

3. *What proxy mechanisms does Spring use?*
   JDK dynamic proxies if interfaces are present, otherwise CGLIB to subclass concrete classes.

## 3. Type of Advices inside AOP

**Explanations + use case**

* **@Before advice**: Executes before method.
* **@AfterReturning advice**: Executes after successful return.
* **@AfterThrowing advice**: Executes if method throws exception.
* **@After (finally) advice**: Executes regardless of outcome.
* **@Around advice**: Wraps method, control before/after/exception.

Use case: transaction management with commit or rollback.

**Summary (5 lines)**
Spring AOP supports five advice types: `@Before`, `@AfterReturning`, `@AfterThrowing`, `@After` (finally), and `@Around`. Each allows developers to insert behavior at different method execution phases: before, after success, after exception, always, or completely wrapping the invocation. `@Around` is the most powerful, letting you control whether the target method executes and inspect return values or exceptions. Use these for logging, security, transaction management, etc.

```java
@Around("execution(* com.myapp.service.*.*(..))")
public Object around(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp) throws Throwable {
  System.out.println("Before");
  Object res = pjp.proceed();
  System.out.println("After");
  return res;
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. *When use @AfterThrowing vs @AfterReturning?*
   Use `@AfterThrowing` to handle exceptions; `@AfterReturning` for normal completion.

2. *Why choose @Around?*
   Because you can control invocation, measure duration, modify inputs or outputs.

3. *Can you use multiple advices on same pointcut?*
   Yes. Order can be controlled via `@Order` or aspect precedence.

---

## 4. Configuring Advices inside AOP - Theory

**Explanations + use case**

* **XML-based configuration**: Define aspects, pointcuts, advice in XML.
* **Bean declarations**: Aspect beans defined in Spring context.
* **Advice wiring**: reference method names for advice types.
* **Pointcut expressions via `<aop:pointcut>`**.
* **Weaving enabled via `<aop:config>`**.

Use case: non‑annotation legacy configuration for logging and transactions.

**Summary (5 lines)**
Before annotations, Spring AOP was configured using XML. You wrap components in `<aop:config>`, define named pointcuts and advice elements (`<before>`, `<after>`, etc.), and specify aspect beans and advice methods. This approach keeps cross‑cutting logic externalized in XML. While more verbose, it supports segregation of configuration and code. It remains useful when annotations cannot be used.

```xml
<aop:config>
  <aop:aspect ref="loggingAspect">
    <aop:pointcut id="svc" expression="execution(* com.myapp.service.*.*(..))"/>
    <aop:before pointcut-ref="svc" method="logBefore"/>
  </aop:aspect>
</aop:config>
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. *Why might you use XML configuration vs annotations?*
   For legacy systems or when you can’t modify classes, XML keeps aspects externalized.

2. *How do you reference an advice method in XML?*
   Via the `method` attribute of `<before>`, `<after>`, etc., pointing to methods in the aspect bean.

3. *What’s the role of `<aop:config>`?*
   It enables Spring AOP and encloses aspect definitions and pointcuts.

---

## 5. Configuring @Around advice

**Explanations + use case**

* Annotate method with `@Around`.
* Method signature must accept `ProceedingJoinPoint`.
* Use `pjp.proceed()` to invoke target.
* Surround with logic before and after.
* Can catch exceptions and modify return.

Use case: performance timing of each service call.

**Summary (5 lines)**
`@Around` advice gives full control before and after the target method and on exceptions. Provided a `ProceedingJoinPoint`, injecting pre‑logic, calling `proceed()`, then injecting post‑logic or error handling. Common use: monitor execution time, manage transactions, or control method invocation itself (e.g. skip under conditions). You can also modify arguments and return values. It's the most powerful advice type.

```java
@Around("execution(* com.myapp.service.*.*(..))")
public Object profile(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp) throws Throwable {
  long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
  Object ret = pjp.proceed();
  System.out.println("Time: "+(System.currentTimeMillis()-start));
  return ret;
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. *What happens if you don’t call `proceed()` inside @Around?*
   The target method never executes, effectively blocking the call.

2. *Can you modify input arguments within @Around?*
   Yes, by using `pjp.getArgs()`, altering them, then `pjp.proceed(newArgs)`.

3. *Is it possible to catch and suppress exceptions in @Around?*
   Yes—you can catch the exception and return alternative value instead of throwing.

---

## 6. Configuring @Before advice

**Explanations + use case**

* Annotate method with `@Before`.
* Accept optional `JoinPoint` parameter.
* Executes before target method.
* Cannot change arguments or return value.
* Use for logging, security checks, metrics.

Use case: check user authorization before service runs.

**Summary (5 lines)**
`@Before` advice runs just before the target method executes. It can inspect method signature and arguments but cannot alter them or the return. It's suited for pre‑conditions like logging, security, input validation. It's simple and lightweight: once a matching join point is reached, the advice fires first. After that, control passes to target method.

```java
@Before("execution(* com.myapp.service.*.*(..))")
public void authCheck(JoinPoint jp) {
  // e.g. throw if no auth
  System.out.println("Authorizing "+ jp.getSignature());
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. *Can @Before advice modify arguments?*
   No. It’s read‑only regarding method arguments and return values.

2. *What happens if @Before advice throws an exception?*
   Target method is not executed; exception propagates to caller.

3. *Which use cases suit @Before?*
   Logging entry, security checks, input validation.

---

## 7. Configuring @AfterThrowing and @AfterReturning advices

**Explanations + use case**

* `@AfterReturning`: runs after method succeeds, can access return value.
* `@AfterThrowing`: runs when method throws specified exception, can access exception.
* Use `returning` and `throwing` parameters to bind values.
* Both defined on same or separate methods.
* Combined for success‑failure handling.

Use case: audit outcomes: log successes and record exceptions differently.

**Summary (5 lines)**
`@AfterReturning` advice executes after successful method completion and can capture and inspect the return value. `@AfterThrowing` executes if a method throws an exception and can access the thrown exception. These advices are helpful for outcome-specific logic—logging, audit trails, error notification. They need `returning` or `throwing` attribute to bind method data. Together, they cover both success and failure scenarios.

```java
@AfterReturning(pointcut="execution(* com.myapp.service.*.*(..))", returning="result")
public void logSuccess(JoinPoint jp, Object result){
  System.out.println("Returned: "+ result);
}
@AfterThrowing(pointcut="execution(* com.myapp.service.*.*(..))", throwing="ex")
public void logError(JoinPoint jp, Exception ex){
  System.out.println("Exception: "+ ex);
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. *How bind return value in @AfterReturning?*
   Use the `returning="result"` attribute; method must accept that parameter.

2. *Can an @AfterThrowing advice recover from exception?*
   No, it only observes; it cannot suppress exception.

3. *Do @AfterReturning and @AfterThrowing run if method is void?*
   Yes. `@AfterReturning` binds the return value as `null`; exception advice still works on thrown exceptions.

---

## 8. Configuring Advices inside AOP with Annotations approach

**Explanations + use case**

* Use `@Aspect`, `@Component` on aspect class.
* Use advice annotations `@Before`, `@AfterReturning`, etc.
* Define pointcut with `@Pointcut`.
* Spring auto‑detects via component scan.
* No XML; purely annotation‑based.

Use case: modern Spring Boot app using annotation‑driven AOP.

**Summary (5 lines)**
Annotation‑based configuration simplifies AOP setup in Spring. By annotating an aspect class with `@Aspect` and marking as a Spring bean (`@Component`), advice methods annotated with `@Before`, `@Around`, etc., automatically apply to matching join points defined by `@Pointcut`. Spring Boot automatically scans and configures these. This approach is concise, type‑safe, and keeps config with code. Recommended in modern applications.

```java
@Aspect
@Component
public class AppAspect {
  @Pointcut("execution(* com.myapp.service.*.*(..))")
  public void svc(){}
  @Before("svc()") public void bm(JoinPoint jp){...}
  @AfterReturning("svc()") public void ar(...){...}
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. *How do you enable annotation AOP in Spring Boot?*
   It’s enabled by default in Boot. For label‑based context you can use `@EnableAspectJAutoProxy`.

2. *Do you still need `<aop:config>`?*
   No, with annotations you don’t need XML; Boot auto‑detects aspects.

3. *Can pointcut expressions refer to multiple packages?*
   Yes, using wildcards like `execution(* com.myapp..*Service.*(..))`.

---

## 9. Demo of Configuring Advices inside AOP with Annotations approach

**Explanations + use case**

* Create Spring Boot app and aspect.
* Define `@Pointcut` and several advice.
* Use a test service method.
* Autowire service and invoke method.
* Observe advice being triggered in console.

**Summary (5 lines)**
A demo shows a simple Spring Boot application with a service and an aspect. The aspect uses `@Before`, `@AfterReturning`, `@AfterThrowing`, and `@Around` on service methods. When calling the service, logs appear as configured. This illustrates the flow of advice in live runtime. Everything is configured via annotations and Spring Boot autoconfiguration.

```java
@SpringBootApplication public class DemoApp {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    var ctx = SpringApplication.run(DemoApp.class, args);
    var svc = ctx.getBean(MyService.class);
    try { svc.doWork("hello"); svc.doWork(null); }
    catch(Exception e){}
  }
}
@Service public class MyService {
  public String doWork(String input){
    if(input==null) throw new IllegalArgumentException("null");
    return "Done: "+ input;
  }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. *How does Spring Boot detect your aspect?*
   It scans `@Component` classes on startup and sees `@Aspect`; proxies are created accordingly.

2. *What happens if aspect and target are in different packages?*
   Only if they are in packages included in `@ComponentScan`.

3. *How can you test that advice ran?*
   By observing log output or using integration tests with AOP proxies (e.g., `@Autowired` bean and verifying behavior).

## 10. "Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) inside Spring framework" Quiz

**Explanations + use case**
I'll propose three questions and answers:

**Summary (5 lines)**
A quiz can reinforce AOP understanding: join points, advice types, weaving. Example questions test ability to choose correct advice or explain proxy behavior. Answer explanations help clarify misconceptions. Use quiz in learning sessions or interviews.

```text
Q1: Which advice can prevent target method execution?  
Q2: How does Spring decide between JDK proxy and CGLIB?  
Q3: How bind exceptions in @AfterThrowing?
```

**Interview‑style Q\&A**

1. **Q1:** Which advice can skip target execution?
   **A1:** Only `@Around`, because it can omit calling `proceed()`.

2. **Q2:** If a bean implements an interface, what proxy type does Spring use by default?
   **A2:** JDK dynamic proxy implementing the interface; if no interface, CGLIB subclassing.

3. **Q3:** Show a signature for `@AfterThrowing` capturing `RuntimeException`.
   **A3:** `@AfterThrowing(pointcut="...", throwing="ex") public void handle(JoinPoint jp, RuntimeException ex){…}`.

---

## 11. Building Web Applications using Spring Boot and Spring MVC

**Explanations + use case**

* **Spring Boot starter**: simplifies dependencies, auto‑configuration.
* **Spring MVC annotations**: `@Controller`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`.
* **Model and view**: `Model` to pass data, `Thymeleaf` or JSP views.
* **REST controllers**: `@RestController`, JSON responses.
* **Application properties**: configure port, database, logging in `application.properties`.

Use case: build a hello‑user web app and a REST endpoint serving JSON.

**Summary (5 lines)**
Using Spring Boot and Spring MVC, you quickly build web apps using auto‑configuration and minimal boilerplate. Annotate controllers with `@Controller` or `@RestController`, map URLs using `@GetMapping`, etc. Use `Model` and view templates (e.g. Thymeleaf) for HTML or produce JSON directly. The Boot starter handles embedding Tomcat, property management, and dependency setup. This approach makes developing full‑stack web apps in Java efficient and scalable.

```java
@RestController public class HelloController {
  @GetMapping("/hello")
  public String hi(@RequestParam(defaultValue="World") String name){
    return "Hello, "+ name;
  }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. *What’s the difference between `@Controller` and `@RestController`?*
   `@RestController` is shorthand for `@Controller+@ResponseBody`, returning JSON/text directly.

2. *How do you add view templates?*
   Include Thymeleaf (or other) dependency and create `.html` files under `src/main/resources/templates`.

3. *Where configure port and DB parameters?*
   In `application.properties` or `application.yml` (e.g. `server.port=8081`).

Sure! Here's a structured breakdown covering each topic in depth, with real‑time use‑case examples, bullet‑point explanations, a 5‑line summary plus code snippet, and 3 interview Q\&A for each. Ready? Let’s go.

---

## 1. Quick Introduction about Web Applications

### Real-time Use‐case Coding Example

*Suppose a book‑review site client sends HTTP requests; the app responds with HTML or JSON.*

### Explainer (5 bullets)

* Web apps handle client requests over HTTP/HTTPS via browser or REST clients.
* They run on servers (e.g. Tomcat, Jetty, Spring Boot embedded server).
* Use URLs to map endpoints to handlers/controllers.
* Deliver dynamic content by querying databases or performing business logic.
* Typically separate frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) from backend logic (Java, Spring, etc.).

### Summary (5 lines)

A web application is a server‑based program accessible via browser or HTTP clients. It receives requests, processes business logic, and returns a response such as HTML or JSON. Modern web apps often follow MVC or REST architectural patterns. They interact with data stores, integrate business services, and support session or stateless operations. Java web apps use technologies like Servlets, JSP, Spring MVC, REST controllers, etc.

```java
@GetMapping("/books")
public List<Book> listBooks() {
  return bookService.findAll();
}
```

### 3 Interview Q\&A

**Q1:** What makes a web application different from a desktop app?
**A:** Web apps run on a server and users interact via HTTP; desktop apps run locally with direct UI rendering.
**Q2:** Why use RESTful endpoints?
**A:** REST endpoints enable stateless, lightweight communication suited for diverse clients.
**Q3:** What's MVC?
**A:** A pattern separating Model (data), View (presentation), and Controller (logic) for maintainable apps.

---

## 2. Role of Servlets inside Web Applications

### Real-time Use‐case Coding Example

*Intercept requests to /hello and generate a text response.*

### Explainer

* Servlets are Java classes managing low‑level HTTP requests and responses.
* They operate inside a Servlet container (Tomcat, Jetty).
* Handle `doGet`, `doPost` methods for client interactions.
* Serve as base for frameworks (Spring MVC wraps servlets).
* Provide access to `HttpServletRequest`, `HttpServletResponse`, sessions, filters.

### Summary

Servlets are the foundational Java component for handling web requests in server containers. They map URLs and implement lifecycle methods like `init()` and `destroy()`. Most modern Java MVC and REST frameworks build on top of servlets. They manage request parsing, response writing, cookie/session support. You override `doGet()` or `doPost()` to process incoming data and send back results.

```java
@WebServlet("/hello")
public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {
  protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
      throws IOException {
    resp.setContentType("text/plain");
    resp.getWriter().write("Hello, world!");
  }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

**Q1:** How does servlet lifecycle work?
**A:** Container loads servlet, calls `init()`, then handles requests via `service()` → `doGet/doPost`, and finally `destroy()`.
**Q2:** When use servlets directly vs frameworks?
**A:** Direct servlets when you need minimal configuration or very simple logic; frameworks for richer features.
**Q3:** How to manage concurrency in servlets?
**A:** Servlets are multithreaded by default. Synchronize shared resources or use thread‑safe components.

## 3. Evolution of Web Apps inside Java Ecosystem

### Real-time Use‐case Coding Example

*JSP/Servlet → Struts → Spring MVC → Spring Boot REST microservice.*

### Explainer

* Early days: raw Servlets and JSP for server‑side rendering.
* Frameworks like Struts, JSF added abstraction and component models.
* Spring MVC introduced annotation‑based controllers and dependency injection.
* RESTful services rose in Spring Boot era with auto‑configuration.
* Microservices and cloud deployment shaped modern app design.

### Summary

Java web development evolved from raw Servlets/JSP to rich frameworks like Struts and JSF. Spring MVC revolutionized the ecosystem by separating concerns and leveraging annotations, dependency injection. Spring Boot further simplified setup with embedded servers and auto‑configuration, enabling rapid REST‑based microservice development. Today, cloud‑native architecture with containers and reactive paradigms continues evolution.

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class BookController {
  @GetMapping("/books")
  public List<Book> books() {...}
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

**Q1:** Why was Spring MVC better than Struts?
**A:** It offered cleaner annotation‑based coding, DI, and lighter configuration than Struts.
**Q2:** What problem does Spring Boot solve?
**A:** It eliminates boilerplate, auto‑configures infrastructure, and embeds a server for easy startup.
**Q3:** What’s a microservice in Java web context?
**A:** A small, independently deployable REST‑based service, typically built using Spring Boot.

---

## 4. Types of Web Apps we can build with Spring

### Real-time Use‑case Coding Example

*RESTful JSON API, server‑side MVC, full-stack with Thymeleaf, GraphQL, Reactive.*

### Explainer

* Traditional server‑rendered MVC apps with Thymeleaf or JSP.
* REST APIs returning JSON for SPA or mobile clients.
* GraphQL endpoints for flexible queries.
* Reactive, non‑blocking web apps using Spring WebFlux.
* WebSocket apps for real‑time communication.

### Summary

Spring supports building server‑rendered MVC apps, RESTful APIs, GraphQL services, reactive non‑blocking applications with WebFlux, and real‑time WebSocket‑based applications. It is flexible enough to power full‑stack systems using templates like Thymeleaf or serve as backend APIs for SPA/mobile. You can choose synchronous or reactive paradigms depending on needs.

```java
@RestController
public class Api {
  @GetMapping("/items") { return itemService.findAll(); }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

**Q1:** When would you use Spring WebFlux?
**A:** For high‑concurrency, low‑latency non‑blocking applications on reactive stacks.
**Q2:** What’s the benefit of GraphQL over REST?
**A:** Clients can request exactly the fields they need, reducing over‑ or under‑fetching.
**Q3:** How does WebSocket work in Spring?
**A:** You define message handlers via `@MessageMapping` and clients subscribe to topics for real‑time push.

## 5. Introduction to Spring Boot – The Hero of Spring framework

### Real-time Use‑case Coding Example

*Creating a microservice in minutes using Spring Boot CLI or Spring Initializr.*

### Explainer

* Spring Boot simplifies Spring application setup via auto‑configuration.
* It embeds a servlet container (e.g., Tomcat) so no external deployment needed.
* Offers opinionated defaults to avoid configuration fatigue.
* Lets you package as executable JAR for easy deployment.
* Supports production‑ready features: metrics, health checks, externalized config.

### Summary

Spring Boot is a convention-over-configuration framework that dramatically speeds up building Spring-based apps. By embedding Tomcat/Jetty, offering auto-configuration, and providing starter dependencies, you can bootstrap services rapidly. It produces standalone JARs, includes metrics/health endpoints, supports flexible configuration via external properties, and is ideal for microservice architectures.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class App {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(App.class, args);
  }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

**Q1:** What’s a "starter" in Spring Boot?
**A:** A starter is a curated dependency that brings in related modules (e.g. `spring-boot-starter-web`).
**Q2:** How does auto‑configuration know what to configure?
**A:** It checks classpath dependencies, bean definitions, and environment to pick defaults.
**Q3:** What are Actuator endpoints?
**A:** Endpoints like `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/metrics` for monitoring and management.

---

## 6. Spring Boot Important Features

### Real-time Use‑case Coding Example

*Add Actuator, custom health indicator, external config via `application.yml`, profile‑specific settings.*

### Explainer

* **Auto-configuration**: wires required beans based on classpath and exclusions.
* **Starters**: one-line dependencies for common setups (web, JPA, security).
* **Actuator**: built-in endpoints for health, metrics, auditing.
* **Externalized Configuration**: `application.properties` or `.yml`, env variables, profiles.
* **Embedded Server**: runs on its own without wars.

### Summary

Key Spring Boot features include auto‑configuration to reduce boilerplate, starter POMs to manage dependencies, embedded server for standalone running, Actuator for observability, and flexible externalized configuration via properties/yaml/profiles. These features make development and deployment faster, more consistent, and production-ready with minimal effort.

```yaml
# application.yml
server:
  port: 9090
spring:
  profiles:
    active: dev
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health,info
```

### Interview Q\&A

**Q1:** How to disable auto‑configuration?
**A:** Use `@SpringBootApplication(exclude = { … })` or `spring.autoconfigure.exclude` properties.
**Q2:** How to specify active profile?
**A:** Via `spring.profiles.active` in `application.properties` or environment/CLI args.
**Q3:** How to add custom actuator endpoint?
**A:** Implement `Endpoint` interface or use `@Endpoint` and expose via management endpoints.

---

## 7. Creating Simple Web Application using Spring Boot

### Real‑time Use‑case Coding Example

*Controller returning Thymeleaf‑rendered view.*

### Explainer

* Create a Spring Initializr or Maven project with `spring‑boot‑starter‑web` and `spring‑boot‑starter‑thymeleaf`.
* Write a `@Controller` class with `@GetMapping` returning view name.
* Create `templates/hello.html` with Thymeleaf markup.
* Spring Boot auto‑configures view resolver.
* Run `mvn spring-boot:run` to launch.

### Summary

To build a simple web application in Spring Boot, start a project with web and optionally template engine starters. Define a controller class mapped to endpoints and return template names. Place view files in `src/main/resources/templates`. Spring Boot auto‑configures MVC infrastructure (view resolvers, static resource handlers). Then run the application; it will serve dynamic HTML pages with minimal setup.

```java
@Controller
public class HelloController {
  @GetMapping("/hello")
  public String hello(Model m) {
    m.addAttribute("name","World");
    return "hello";
  }
}
// templates/hello.html uses Thymeleaf to display name.
```

### Interview Q\&A

**Q1:** Where should view templates go?
**A:** Under `src/main/resources/templates` for Thymeleaf/JSP.
**Q2:** What's the default view resolver?
**A:** ThymeleafViewResolver when Thymeleaf starter is present.
**Q3:** Where do static assets like JS/CSS should reside?
**A:** `src/main/resources/static`.

---

## 8. Running Simple Web Application using Spring Boot

### Real‑time Use‑case Coding Example

*Run via `main()` in IDE or `mvn spring‑boot:run`.*

### Explainer

* Launch via the `public static void main()` method with `SpringApplication.run()`.
* Alternatively, use Maven/Gradle plugin: `mvn spring-boot:run` or `gradle bootRun`.
* Spring Boot starts embedded Tomcat on default port 8080.
* Logs show URL and context.
* Access endpoints in browser or curl.

### Summary

You can run a Spring Boot application directly from IDE by executing the `main()` method. Alternatively, use Maven or Gradle CLI to start the embedded server. By default, it listens on port 8080 and maps root context. It auto-launches with no need for external servlet container, letting developers iterate quickly. Logs indicate server startup time and URL endpoints.

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  SpringApplication.run(App.class, args);
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

**Q1:** How do you run Spring Boot from command line?
**A:** Use `mvn spring-boot:run` or `gradle bootRun`, or run the packaged jar with `java -jar`.
**Q2:** How to build executable jar?
**A:** `mvn package` generates a fat jar including dependencies.
**Q3:** How to log the server port on startup?
**A:** Set `logging.level.org.springframework.boot.web=DEBUG` or customize `ApplicationListener`.

---

## 9. Changing the Default Server Port & Context Path of SpringBoot Web Application

### Real‑time Use‑case Coding Example

*Override port to 9090 and context path to `/api` in config.*

### Explainer

* Set `server.port=9090` in properties or yaml.
* Set `server.servlet.context-path=/api`.
* Alternatively use environment variables or CLI args: `--server.port=9090`.
* Supports profile-specific overrides.
* Default port 8080 and context path root differ.

### Summary

You can customize Spring Boot’s server port and context path by configuring `server.port` and `server.servlet.context-path` in `application.properties` or `.yml`, or by passing command‑line arguments or environment variables. For example, `server.port=9090` launches on 9090, while `server.servlet.context-path=/api` changes the base URL. This flexibility helps avoid port clashes and standardizes URL structure.

```yaml
server:
  port: 9090
  servlet:
    context-path: /api
```

### Interview Q\&A

**Q1:** How to override port at runtime?
**A:** Use `--server.port=9090` on CLI or `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON`.
**Q2:** How to change context path without config file?
**A:** Use `application.properties` or command‑line e.g. `--server.servlet.context-path=/app`.
**Q3:** Can you configure port per profile?
**A:** Yes, define in `application-dev.yml`, `application-prod.yml`, etc.

---

## 10. Random Server Port Number inside SpringBoot

### Real‑time Use‑case Coding Example

*Configure `server.port=0` to pick a random free port.*

### Explainer

* Setting `server.port=0` instructs Spring Boot to use a random available port.
* Useful in tests to avoid port conflicts.
* Printed in logs (`… started on port(s): 54762`).
* You can retrieve actual port via `WebServerApplicationContext`.
* Handy for integration tests or parallel instances.

### Summary

By setting `server.port=0`, Spring Boot chooses a free random port at runtime. This is ideal for integration testing or running multiple instances without port collisions. The actual port is printed in logs and can be accessed programmatically via the application context.

```yaml
server:
  port: 0
```

```java
int port = ((WebServerApplicationContext) ctx)
               .getWebServer().getPort();
```

### Interview Q\&A

**Q1:** Why use port 0?
**A:** To dynamically allocate a free port, avoiding hard-coded values.
**Q2:** How to programmatically fetch the port?
**A:** Use `WebServerApplicationContext.getWebServer().getPort()`.
**Q3:** Is random port viable for production?
**A:** Not ideal; good for testing but production needs fixed predictable ports.

---

## 11. Demo of Spring Boot Autoconfiguration

### Real‑time Use‑case Coding Example

*Spring Boot detects `spring-boot-starter-web` and auto‑configures DispatcherServlet, a Tomcat server, Jackson for JSON.*

### Explainer

* Auto‑configuration classes examine presence of classes/beans, e.g. `DispatcherServlet` if `spring-webmvc`.
* Enable via `@SpringBootApplication`.
* Custom beans override defaults.
* You can exclude specific auto‑configs with `exclude` or property.
* Profiles and conditions (`@ConditionalOnClass`, `OnMissingBean`) control behavior.

### Summary

Spring Boot auto‑configuration automatically sets up components based on the classpath and existing beans. For a web starter, it configures embedded server, MVC setup, JSON support, static resources, etc. If you provide your own bean, defaults are overridden. You can disable specific auto‑configs via exclusions. This mechanism lets developers focus on business logic rather than boilerplate configuration.

```java
@SpringBootApplication(exclude = {DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class})
public class MyApp { ... }
```

### Interview Q\&A

**Q1:** How does Spring Boot know which auto‑configs to apply?
**A:** It uses `@Conditional` annotations (e.g. on classpath, bean presence) and `spring.factories` metadata.
**Q2:** How do you override an auto‑configured bean?
**A:** Provide a bean of the same type or name in your configuration; it will override.

## 1. “Building Web Applications using Spring Boot and Spring MVC” Quiz

### Use‑Case Example

Real‑time: a simple book management CRUD REST + MVC pages.

### 5 Explanations

* Spring Boot auto‑configures Spring MVC and embedded Tomcat allowing rapid setup.
* Controllers annotated with `@Controller` or `@RestController` map web requests to handler methods.
* Views (e.g. Thymeleaf) are resolved via ViewResolver to render pages.
* REST endpoints can be combined with MVC pages in same app.
* Boot provides starter dependencies (`spring-boot-starter-web`) to integrate MVC seamlessly.

### Summary (5 lines)

A Spring Boot web application is built using starters that pull in Spring MVC and embed a servlet container. Controllers define handlers for HTTP requests using annotations. Views can be JSP, Thymeleaf or others and are auto‑resolved. REST and MVC paradigms co‑exist in the same Boot app. Spring Boot simplifies web app setup and deployment.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class App { public static void main(String[] args){ SpringApplication.run(App.class,args);} }

@Controller
public class BookController {
  @GetMapping("/books") public String list(Model m){
    m.addAttribute("list", List.of(new Book(1,"Title")));
    return "books"; }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **What does `@RestController` do?**
   It combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, so methods return JSON directly.
2. **How does Spring Boot pick a view template?**
   It auto‑configures a `ThymeleafViewResolver` or other, scanning `src/main/resources/templates`.
3. **What starter dependency is needed for MVC apps?**
   `spring-boot-starter-web` which brings Spring MVC and embedded Tomcat.

## 2. Quick Tip – Mapping multiple paths inside Spring Web Application

### Use‑Case Example

Single handler responds to both `/home` and `/index`.

### 5 Explanations

* `@RequestMapping` or `@GetMapping` accepts an array of paths.
* Allows reuse of same logic for multiple URL patterns.
* Reduces duplicate code in controllers.
* Supports path variables and parameters across multiple mappings.
* Combined with method-level annotations for clarity.

### Summary (5 lines)

Spring MVC allows mapping multiple URL paths to one handler method using arrays inside the mapping annotation. This helps serve the same endpoint logic under different route names. It simplifies code and avoids duplication. Parameters and method signatures remain consistent. It works seamlessly in both Boot and plain Spring MVC apps.

```java
@GetMapping({"/home", "/index", "/"})
public String showHome(Model model) {
    model.addAttribute("now", LocalDateTime.now());
    return "home";
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **Can you map both GET and POST to same method?**
   Yes using `@RequestMapping(value={"/path1","/path2"}, method={RequestMethod.GET, RequestMethod.POST})`.
2. **What about path variables?**
   You must include same variable pattern in each path, e.g. `"/user/{id}", "/member/{id}"`.
3. **Could this cause ambiguity?**
   If paths overlap, Spring may throw ambiguous mapping exception — avoid overlapping patterns.

---

## 3. Introduction to Spring Boot DevTools

### Use‑Case Example

Auto‑restart and live reload when editing: editing HTML or Java class triggers reload.

### 5 Explanations

* DevTools watches classpath resources and restarts the app on changes.
* Includes LiveReload integration for browser auto-refresh.
* Disables caches and static resource caching for fast iteration.
* Automatically enables remote debugging and development‑only properties.
* Excluded from production by default (via scope=“runtime”).

### Summary (5 lines)

Spring Boot DevTools enhances development experience by auto‑restarting the application upon code changes and reloading the browser via LiveReload. It disables template and resource caching, making changes visible immediately. DevTools enables remote debug and activates developer‑only properties by default. It is non‑invasive and excluded from production builds. Installation is as simple as adding the dependency.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **How does DevTools restart the app?**
   It launches two classloaders—one for restartable classes—restarting only custom classes.
2. **Does it work in packaged jar mode?**
   It works only in IDE run/`spring-boot:run`, not when running packaged jar externally.
3. **Is DevTools included in final build?**
   No, it's scoped to `runtime` by default and excluded from fat jars.

---

## 4. Implementation & Demo of Spring Boot DevTools

### Use‑Case Example

Modify controller class or static resources, see server restart and browser reload.

### 5 Explanations

* Run via `mvn spring-boot:run` or IDE.
* Save changes: DevTools detects file change and triggers restart.
* Browser refresh happens automatically if LiveReload extension running.
* Logging shows “Restart completed” message.
* Works for `.java`, `.properties`, `.html`, CSS, JS resources.

### Summary (5 lines)

In a live Spring Boot instance started via Maven or IDE, DevTools monitors source and resource directories. When saved, it restarts the app or reloads changed classes and refreshes the browser. Logs indicate restart completion. You can confirm changes by editing a template or controller method. LiveReload plugin in browser enhances UX.

```java
// Controller with greeting
@GetMapping("/greet")
public String greet(Model m) {
    m.addAttribute("msg", "Hello at " + LocalTime.now());
    return "greet";
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **What directories does DevTools watch by default?**
   `src/main/resources`, `src/main/java`, `classpath:/static` and templates.
2. **How to disable LiveReload?**
   Set `spring.devtools.livereload.enabled=false` in `application.properties`.
3. **What happens on fatal errors in restart?**
   DevTools doesn’t restart: you should fix errors and rerun the app manually.

## 5. Deep Dive of Spring MVC Internal Architecture

### Use‑Case Example

Outline request lifecycle: DispatcherServlet → HandlerMapping → HandlerAdapter → ViewResolver.

### 5 Explanations

* DispatcherServlet is the front controller for all HTTP requests.
* HandlerMapping selects controller method by match.
* HandlerAdapter invokes matched method and returns ModelAndView.
* ViewResolver maps view names to actual view templates.
* Interceptors (HandlerInterceptor) can be added before/after handler execution.

### Summary (5 lines)

Spring MVC internal flow begins with DispatcherServlet receiving a request, delegating to HandlerMapping. A HandlerAdapter calls the controller method, yielding a ModelAndView. Post‑processing interceptors apply before view rendering. Finally, ViewResolver picks the template to render the response. This modular design supports customization at each stage.

```java
// Example interceptor for logging
@Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
  @Override
  public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry reg) {
    reg.addInterceptor(new HandlerInterceptorAdapter(){
      @Override
      public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res, Object handler) {
        System.out.println("Before handler: " + req.getRequestURI());
        return true;
      }
    });
  }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **What is DispatcherServlet?**
   The central dispatcher that handles request routing and workflow orchestration in Spring MVC.
2. **How do interceptors differ from filters?**
   Filters are Servlet‑level; interceptors are Spring MVC level with access to handler method info.
3. **How does Spring locate a view?**
   Using configured `ViewResolver`, typically prefix/suffix mappings to find template files.

---

## 6. Quick Tip – Resolving Build & Cache Issues inside Maven Projects

### Use‑Case Example

Clean cache, rebuild to fix stale dependencies or plugin versions.

### 5 Explanations

* Use `mvn clean install -U` to force update snapshots/releases.
* Delete `.m2/repository` entries for corrupted artifacts.
* Clear IDE cache or re-import project if compilation errors persist.
* Use `mvn dependency:purge-local-repository` to remove problematic artifacts.
* Enable verbose logging to diagnose plugin or version mismatches.

### Summary (5 lines)

To solve Maven build and cache issues, it's effective to run full clean builds with forced dependency updates (`-U`) and purge the local repository if necessary. Deleting corrupted artifacts or using `dependency:purge-local-repository` clears cache. IDE caches may also require invalidation. Verbose mode helps identify plugin conflicts. This restores consistent builds.

```bash
mvn clean install -U
# or
mvn dependency:purge-local-repository clean install -U
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **What does `-U` flag do?**
   Forces Maven to check remote repositories and update snapshots/releases even if local copies exist.
2. **When to purge local repo?**
   When artifacts are corrupted or version mismatches persist after updates.
3. **How do you fix IDE-specific build issues?**
   Invalidate/restart IDE, re-import Maven project, ensure Maven wrapper version consistency.

## 7. Submit information from Contact page using @RequestParam

### Use‑Case Example

A contact form sends name and email via query or form parameters to controller.

### 5 Explanations

* Use `@RequestParam("field")` to bind query or form parameters to method args.
* Can set `required=false` and default values.
* Handles simple primitive/String types.
* Supports validation manually inside controller.
* One-off forms or simple endpoints benefit from this.

### Summary (5 lines)

Using `@RequestParam`, you can bind web form inputs or query parameters directly to controller method parameters. It supports default values and optional fields. Best suited for small forms with simple types. Validation logic must be handled explicitly. It’s lightweight and explicit, requiring no model binding.

```java
@PostMapping("/contact")
public String submit(@RequestParam String name,
                     @RequestParam String email,
                     Model model) {
    model.addAttribute("msg", "Thanks, " + name);
    return "contactResult";
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **Is `@RequestParam` required by default?**
   Yes—but you can mark it optional with `required=false` and set `defaultValue`.
2. **How to validate email format?**
   You manually check in controller or delegate to service/validator.
3. **Can `@RequestParam` bind lists or arrays?**
   Yes, e.g. `@RequestParam List<String> tags`, accepts repeated query/form parameters.

---

## 8. Submit information from Contact page using POJO object

### Use‑Case Example

Binding a ContactDTO with fields name, email, message automatically using `@ModelAttribute`.

### 5 Explanations

* `@ModelAttribute` binds form fields to a POJO.
* Supports nested objects and field conversion.
* Enables JSR‑303 bean validation with `@Valid`.
* Cleaner controller signatures when many fields.
* Spring auto-instantiates the model object.

### Summary (5 lines)

Using a POJO with `@ModelAttribute`, Spring MVC automatically binds form data to an object instance. This enables structured binding, type conversion, and easier validation. Controllers remain clean and maintainable as forms grow. JSR‑303 annotations can enforce constraints. It’s ideal for forms with multiple fields or nested data.

```java
public class Contact {
  private String name;
  private String email;
  private String message;
  // getters/setters
}

@PostMapping("/contact")
public String submit(@ModelAttribute @Valid Contact contact, BindingResult br, Model m) {
    if(br.hasErrors()) return "contactForm";
    m.addAttribute("msg", "Received from " + contact.getName());
    return "contactResult";
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **What’s the difference between `@RequestParam` and `@ModelAttribute`?**
   `@RequestParam` binds individual parameters; `@ModelAttribute` binds whole form into a POJO.
2. **How to trigger validation?**
   Use `@Valid` and inspect `BindingResult`.
3. **Can nested POJOs be bound?**
   Yes, if form field names match nested structure (e.g. `address.street`).

---

## 9. Deep dive of Lombok library

### Use‑Case Example

Reduce boilerplate in entity class with `@Data`, `@AllArgsConstructor`, `@NoArgsConstructor`.

### 5 Explanations

* Lombok generates getters, setters, constructors, equals/hashCode, toString at compile time.
* `@Slf4j` injects a static SLF4J logger field.
* `@Builder` creates fluent builders.
* Reduces verbosity and improves readability of domain classes.
* Requires IDE plugin or annotation processing enabled.

### Summary (5 lines)

Lombok is a compile‑time code generator that drastically reduces boilerplate, especially in Java beans. Annotations like `@Data`, `@Builder`, `@Slf4j`, and constructors simplify entity and service class definitions. It integrates via annotation processors and requires IDE support. The generated code is equivalent to manually written getters/setters. Lombok speeds development and boosts maintainability.

```java
@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Builder
public class User {
  private Long id;
  private String name;
  private String email;
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **What does `@Data` cover?**
   It includes getters, setters, `toString()`, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and a required‑args constructor.
2. **Any downsides to Lombok?**
   IDE dependency, possible confusion for newcomers, and sometimes obscured generated code.
3. **Is Lombok safe for production use?**
   Yes, it only influences compile time and the generated bytecode is plain Java code.

---

## 10. Introduction to Lombok library

This is essentially similar to above—boilerplate reduction in Java.

### 5 Explanations

* Simplifies Java bean code by auto-generating repetitive methods.
* Works via annotations (`@Getter`, `@Setter`, etc.).
* Supports builder pattern (`@Builder`).
* Requires annotation processing enabled in build and IDE.
* Lightweight and compile‑only dependency.

### Summary (5 lines)

Lombok provides a set of annotations to automatically generate common Java code like getters, setters, constructors, and builders. It's designed to improve readability by reducing boilerplate. You need to enable annotation processing and often install an IDE plugin. The output class files include the generated methods, no runtime dependency. Lombok is widely used in modern Spring Boot applications.

```java
@Getter @Setter
public class Product {
  private Long id;
  private String name;
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **How to enable Lombok in IntelliJ?**
   Install Lombok plugin and enable annotation processing in settings.
2. **What happens if you forget annotation processing?**
   Generated methods won’t appear, causing compilation errors.
3. **Does Lombok add extra runtime libraries?**
   No, it’s compile-time only; no dependency in runtime classpath unless annotations require it.

---

## 11. Implementing Lombok inside Web App

### Use‑Case Example

Using Lombok in Spring Boot entity, DTO, controller classes instead of manual boilerplate.

### 5 Explanations

* Add Lombok dependency in `pom.xml`.
* Annotate DTOs, entities, controllers with Lombok annotations.
* Clean code without manual getters and constructors.
* Works with `@Slf4j` inside `@Service` and `@Controller`.
* Speeds up writing request/response DTOs and domain models.

### Summary (5 lines)

To implement Lombok in a Spring Boot web application, include the Lombok dependency and enable annotation processing. Use annotations like `@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@Data`, and `@Slf4j` in entities, controllers, and services. This drastically reduces class verbosity and improves maintainability. Logging becomes simpler with a generated logger. Integration is seamless and boosts productivity.

```java
@Controller
@Slf4j
public class HomeController {
  @GetMapping("/")
  public String home(Model model) {
    log.info("Rendering home");
    model.addAttribute("time", LocalTime.now());
    return "home";
  }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **How do you log with Lombok?**
   Use `@Slf4j` annotation and call `log.info(...)`.
2. **Is Lombok required at runtime?**
   No, generated code is part of compiled class; Lombok library not required at runtime.
3. **What compile‑time plugin is needed?**
   The Lombok annotation-processor, enabled in IDE/build tool.

---

## 12. Demo of @Slf4j annotation from Lombok library

### Use‑Case Example

Controller logs requests using `@Slf4j` without manual logger setup.

### 5 Explanations

* `@Slf4j` injects a `private static final org.slf4j.Logger log` field.
* You can directly call `log.debug()`, `log.error()`, etc.
* No manual instantiation like `LoggerFactory.getLogger(...)`.
* Keeps code cleaner and consistent across classes.
* Supports other logging annotations like `@Log4j2` or `@CommonsLog`.

### Summary (5 lines)

By annotating your class with `@Slf4j`, Lombok automatically generates a logger instance for SLF4J. You can immediately use `log.info()`, `log.warn()`, `log.error()`, etc., without boilerplate. This makes logging concise and consistent. It avoids repetitive code and configures the correct logger per class. It’s helpful across controllers, services, and other Spring components.

```java
@Service
@Slf4j
public class BookingService {
  public void book(String user) {
    log.info("Booking for user {}", user);
    // business logic
  }
}
```

### Interview Q\&A

1. **Which logger interface does `@Slf4j` use?**
   It uses the SLF4J `org.slf4j.Logger`.
2. **Can you change to Log4j2?**
   Yes, use `@Log4j2` instead.
3. **Why prefer `@Slf4j`?**
   It’s framework-agnostic and works with any SLF4J-compatible backend like Logback or Log4j.

## 1. Processing Query Params & Path Variables inside Spring

### Explanation with Real-time Use Case

* Query params and path variables allow RESTful APIs to receive dynamic data from the client.
* **Query Params**: Used for optional filters or search criteria (e.g., `/products?category=books&price=100`).
* **Path Variables**: Used for mandatory resource identification (e.g., `/products/123` to get product with id 123).
* Both are extracted in Spring MVC using annotations `@RequestParam` and `@PathVariable`.
* Useful in building flexible, RESTful APIs handling various client requests efficiently.
* Query params are generally used for filtering, sorting, or pagination, whereas path variables identify specific resources.

### Summary

Processing query parameters and path variables in Spring MVC is fundamental for building REST APIs. Query params provide flexibility in requesting filtered or paginated data, while path variables uniquely identify resources. Spring MVC facilitates this using `@RequestParam` and `@PathVariable` annotations. Using these properly improves the clarity and usability of APIs.

### Code Example

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/products")
public class ProductController {

    // Using PathVariable to get product by id
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public String getProductById(@PathVariable("id") int id) {
        return "Product with ID: " + id;
    }

    // Using RequestParam for optional filters
    @GetMapping
    public String getProductsByCategory(
            @RequestParam(value = "category", required = false) String category,
            @RequestParam(value = "price", required = false) Integer price) {
        return "Products filtered by category: " + category + ", price: " + price;
    }
}
```

### Interview Questions & Answers

1. **Q:** What is the difference between `@RequestParam` and `@PathVariable` in Spring?
   **A:** `@RequestParam` extracts query parameters from the URL, often optional and used for filtering, while `@PathVariable` extracts dynamic parts of the URI path and is used to identify specific resources.

2. **Q:** Can `@RequestParam` be optional? How?
   **A:** Yes, by setting `required=false` in the annotation, making the query parameter optional.

3. **Q:** When should you prefer path variables over query parameters?
   **A:** Path variables should be used to identify a specific resource (e.g., `/users/{id}`), whereas query parameters are better for optional filtering or searching within a collection.

---

## 2. Accepting Query Params using @RequestParam annotation - Theory

### Explanation

* `@RequestParam` binds HTTP query parameters to method parameters in Spring controllers.
* It supports default values and marking parameters as optional or required.
* Useful for filtering, pagination, or any additional metadata sent by the client.
* Spring automatically converts the query string values to the method parameter type.
* Ideal for simple parameters like strings, numbers, booleans, etc.

### Summary

`@RequestParam` is used in Spring MVC to capture query parameters from the URL into controller method arguments. It supports options like required/optional parameters and default values, enabling flexible request handling for search, filter, and other query-based features.

---

## 3. Accepting Query Params using @RequestParam annotation - Coding

### Explanation with Real-time Use Case

* For example, an e-commerce API lets users filter products by category, price range, and availability.
* Each filter corresponds to a query parameter annotated with `@RequestParam`.
* The controller method uses these to generate filtered product lists.

### Code Example

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/products")
public class ProductController {

    @GetMapping("/search")
    public String searchProducts(
            @RequestParam(value = "category", required = false, defaultValue = "all") String category,
            @RequestParam(value = "minPrice", required = false) Integer minPrice,
            @RequestParam(value = "maxPrice", required = false) Integer maxPrice,
            @RequestParam(value = "available", required = false, defaultValue = "true") boolean available) {

        return "Filtering products in category: " + category + ", price between: " + minPrice + " and " + maxPrice + ", available: " + available;
    }
}
```

### Summary

Using `@RequestParam`, you can easily bind HTTP query parameters to method parameters in a Spring controller, specifying defaults and optional values to create flexible, client-driven filters or searches.

### Interview Questions & Answers

1. **Q:** How do you set a default value for a query parameter using `@RequestParam`?
   **A:** Use the `defaultValue` attribute, e.g., `@RequestParam(defaultValue = "all")`.

2. **Q:** What happens if a required query parameter is missing?
   **A:** Spring throws a `MissingServletRequestParameterException` unless `required=false` is set.

3. **Q:** Can `@RequestParam` bind complex types or only simple data types?
   **A:** It binds simple types like String, int, boolean. Complex objects require `@ModelAttribute` or other methods.

---

## 4. Accepting Path Params using @PathVariable annotation - Theory

### Explanation

* `@PathVariable` extracts dynamic segments from the URI path.
* Used when the URL path represents resource identity (e.g., `/orders/{orderId}`).
* Supports type conversion from string path segments to method parameter types.
* Enables clean and RESTful URL design by embedding resource IDs in the path.
* Can bind multiple path variables if the URL contains multiple dynamic segments.

### Summary

`@PathVariable` is an annotation in Spring used to capture dynamic values from the URI path. It is critical in RESTful API design to map URLs that represent resource identifiers directly to method parameters for processing.

---

## 5. Accepting Path Params using @PathVariable annotation - Coding

### Explanation with Real-time Use Case

* Consider a user management API that allows fetching user details by user ID.
* The user ID is part of the path and extracted using `@PathVariable`.

### Code Example

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserController {

    @GetMapping("/{userId}")
    public String getUserDetails(@PathVariable("userId") Long userId) {
        return "User details for userId: " + userId;
    }

    @GetMapping("/{userId}/orders/{orderId}")
    public String getUserOrder(@PathVariable Long userId, @PathVariable Long orderId) {
        return "Order " + orderId + " for user " + userId;
    }
}
```

### Summary

`@PathVariable` makes it easy to extract values from URI paths in Spring MVC, enabling clean and meaningful URLs. It supports multiple variables and automatic type conversion, making REST endpoints expressive and intuitive.

### Interview Questions & Answers

1. **Q:** Can `@PathVariable` be optional in Spring?
   **A:** No, path variables are mandatory. Optional path variables require different URL mappings or workarounds.

2. **Q:** How does Spring convert the path variable string to method parameter type?
   **A:** Spring uses registered converters to automatically convert the String path segment to the parameter type (e.g., Long, Integer).

3. **Q:** Can you have multiple `@PathVariable` parameters in a method?
   **A:** Yes, Spring allows binding multiple path variables corresponding to multiple dynamic parts of the URL.

* Enhance user experience by providing immediate feedback.
* Prevent runtime errors caused by bad data.
* Help comply with business rules and regulatory requirements.

### Summary

Validations are critical in web apps to guarantee the correctness and security of user inputs. They prevent data corruption, enhance application reliability, and improve the overall user experience by enforcing constraints early.

---

## 9. Introduction to Java Bean Validations

### Explanation

* Java Bean Validation API defines a set of annotations and interfaces to apply declarative validation rules.
* Common annotations: `@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Min`, `@Max`, `@Email`.
* Validation is triggered at runtime, often when binding data from HTTP requests.
* Can be integrated with Spring MVC controllers using `@Valid`.
* Supports custom validators for business-specific rules.

### Summary

Java Bean Validation is a standard mechanism to declare constraints on Java objects. It works with frameworks like Spring to validate inputs transparently, ensuring only valid data enters the system.

---

## 10. Adding Bean Validation annotations inside Contact POJO class

### Explanation with Real-time Use Case

* A Contact class represents user contact info with fields like name, email, and phone.
* Bean validation annotations enforce constraints such as non-null name, valid email format.
* Improves data quality before persistence or processing.

### Code Example

```java
public class Contact {

    @NotNull(message = "Name cannot be null")
    @Size(min = 2, max = 50, message = "Name must be 2 to 50 characters")
    private String name;

    @NotNull(message = "Email cannot be null")
    @Email(message = "Email should be valid")
    private String email;

    @Pattern(regexp = "\\d{10}", message = "Phone number must be 10 digits")
    private String phone;

    // getters and setters
}
```

### Summary

Adding Bean Validation annotations in POJO classes helps enforce field-level constraints declaratively, improving data integrity and minimizing manual validation code.

## 11. Adding Bean Validation related changes inside Web Application

### Explanation

* In Spring MVC, use `@Valid` on controller method parameters to trigger validation.
* BindingResult captures validation errors.
* Return meaningful error messages if validation fails.
* Integrate with front-end for user-friendly feedback.
* Ensures backend validation complements client-side checks.

### Code Example

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/contacts")
public class ContactController {

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<String> addContact(@Valid @RequestBody Contact contact, BindingResult result) {
        if (result.hasErrors()) {
            return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(result.getAllErrors().get(0).getDefaultMessage());
        }
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Contact added successfully");
    }
}
```

### Summary

Spring's integration with Bean Validation enables automatic validation of incoming data in controllers. Using `@Valid` and `BindingResult`, developers can handle validation errors gracefully, improving robustness and user experience.

## 1. Beans Web Scopes inside Spring Framework

### Real-Time Use-Case Example

```java
@Controller
public class ExampleController {
    @Autowired
    private MyRequestBean requestBean;
    @Autowired
    private MySessionBean sessionBean;
    @Autowired
    private MyAppBean appBean;

    @GetMapping("/example")
    public String process() {
        requestBean.generateId();
        sessionBean.addVisit();
        appBean.incrementCounter();
        return "view";
    }
}
```

### 🔍 5 Bullet-Point Explanations

* **@RequestScope**: One instance per HTTP request lifecycle.
* **@SessionScope**: Shared for that user session across multiple requests.
* **@ApplicationScope**: Singleton across the entire servlet context.
* Beans instantiated and destroyed according to scope rules.
* Improves resource efficiency and state management.

### ✏️ 5-Line Summary

Spring supports multiple web scopes: request, session, and application. Request scope creates a new bean for each HTTP request. Session scope maintains state across multiple requests by a single user. Application scope provides a single, shared instance across all users and threads. Using appropriate scope improves state management, performance, and resource use.

```java
// Example bean declarations
@Component @RequestScope class MyRequestBean { /*...*/ }
@Component @SessionScope class MySessionBean { /*...*/ }
@Component @ApplicationScope class MyAppBean { /*...*/ }
```

### ❓ Interview Questions

1. **Q:** What’s the difference between request and session scope?
   **A:** Request creates a new instance per HTTP request; session persists across multiple requests by the same client.
2. **Q:** What happens if a @RequestScope bean is injected into a singleton?
   **A:** It fails at startup unless you use `@Lazy` proxy-mode or `ObjectFactory`/`Provider` injection.
3. **Q:** When use @ApplicationScope vs singleton?
   **A:** @ApplicationScope is managed by Spring and tied to servlet context lifecycle; singleton is pure Spring across contexts only.

## 2. Introduction to Spring Web Scopes

### Real-Time Use-Case Example

```java
@RestController
public class IntroController {
    @Autowired private VisitorCounter visitorCounter;

    @GetMapping("/visit")
    public String visit() {
        int count = visitorCounter.increment();
        return "This app has " + count + " visits.";
    }
}
```

### 🔍 5 Bullet-Point Explanations

* Web scopes are lifecycles tied to servlet environment.
* Valid scopes: request, session, application, and websocket.
* Spring proxies or providers support injecting scoped beans into mismatched scopes.
* Scoped beans enhance modularity and state encapsulation.
* Use cases: tracking per-request data, user sessions, global counters.

### ✏️ 5-Line Summary

Spring Web Scopes control bean lifecycles in relation to HTTP requests, user sessions, and application-wide state. They include `@RequestScope`, `@SessionScope`, and `@ApplicationScope`. Proxy support enables scoped beans in singletons. Scoped beans help manage state cleanly and isolate data correctly. They’re essential in web app structure and resource optimization.

```java
@Component @ApplicationScope class VisitorCounter { /*...*/ }
```

### ❓ Interview Questions

1. **Q:** Can you scope a bean per WebSocket session?
   **A:** Yes — use `@Scope("websocket")` with proper config.
2. **Q:** How is web scope implemented under the hood?
   **A:** Via AOP proxies and `RequestContextListener` or `SessionScope` handlers.
3. **Q:** Can scoped beans be injected into singletons?
   **A:** Yes, only through proxies or lazy resolution patterns.

## 3. Use Cases of Spring Web Scopes

### Real-Time Use-Case Example

```java
@RestController
public class CartController {
    @Autowired private ShoppingCart cart;

    @PostMapping("/cart/add")
    public String addItem(@RequestParam String item) {
        cart.add(item);
        return "Cart now has: " + cart.getItems();
    }
}
```

### 🔍 5 Bullet-Point Explanations

* **Request**: Track one-time form submissions, request metadata.
* **Session**: Shopping cart, login sessions, preferences.
* **Application**: Global counters, caches, shared lookup data.
* **WebSocket**: Maintain per-connection chat state.
* **Testing**: Mocks scoped beans independently, improving isolation.

### ✏️ 5-Line Summary

Spring Web Scopes enable precise bean lifecycles: per-request, per-session, or app-wide. Common use cases include form submission handlers, user carts, global metrics, and connection-specific data for WebSockets. Appropriately selecting scopes ensures correct state isolation and preserves memory. It also simplifies testing. Deploying the right scope leads to clean, maintainable web apps.

```java
@Component @SessionScope class ShoppingCart { /*...*/ }
```

### ❓ Interview Questions

1. **Q:** Why not use session scope for everything?
   **A:** It uses memory per user; may lead to leaks, scaling issues.
2. **Q:** How can you clear a session-scoped bean?
   **A:** Use `SessionStatus.setComplete()` in a `@SessionAttributes` controller.
3. **Q:** What if you mix scopes incorrectly?
   **A:** Can lead to stale data or proxy resolution errors.

## 4. Demo of @RequestScope inside Web Application

### Real-Time Use-Case Example

```java
@Controller
class LogController {
  @Autowired private RequestBean rb;
  @GetMapping("/log")
  public String log() {
    rb.logTimestamp();
    return rb.getLogs().toString();
  }
}

@RequestScope
@Component
class RequestBean {
  private List<String> logs = new ArrayList<>();
  void logTimestamp() { logs.add(LocalTime.now().toString()); }
  List<String> getLogs() { return logs; }
}
```

### 🔍 5 Bullet-Point Explanations

* Bean created per HTTP GET `/log`.
* `logs` resets on each request.
* No thread-safety concerns: single-threaded usage.
* Useful for capturing request-specific traces.
* Lightweight and collector-oriented.

### ✏️ 5-Line Summary

A `@RequestScope` bean created anew on every HTTP request ensures clean, isolated data collection per request. It’s ideal for logging, audit, or temporary state. Thread safety isn't required due to per-request instantiation. This improves traceability and avoids cross-request leakage. Injection into controllers works seamlessly when proxied.

```java
// Bean definition included above
```

### ❓ Interview Questions

1. **Q:** Is `@RequestScope` thread-safe?
   **A:** Yes, implicitly, since each request has its own instance.
2. **Q:** Can a `@RequestScope` bean outlive its request?
   **A:** No – it’s destroyed once the request completes.
3. **Q:** How to inject it into a singleton?
   **A:** Use `@Autowired @Lazy RequestBean bean;`

---

## 5. Demo of @SessionScope inside Web Application

### Real-Time Use-Case Example

```java
@Controller
class ScoreController {
  @Autowired private SessionScore score;

  @GetMapping("/score")
  public String show() { return "Score: " + score.increment(); }
}

@SessionScope
@Component
class SessionScore {
  private int score = 0;
  int increment() { return ++score; }
}
```

### 🔍 5 Bullet-Point Explanations

* One bean per user session.
* Score persists across `/score` requests.
* Tied to HttpSession lifecycle.
* Perfect for shopping carts or preferences.
* Cleared when session invalidates.

### ✏️ 5-Line Summary

`@SessionScope` creates one bean instance per user session, perfect for maintaining user-specific state across multiple requests (like counters, carts, or preferences). It ties into the underlying HTTP session and dies when the session ends. Ideal for multi-step workflows and user personalization. Be cautious to avoid memory leaks in high-traffic systems.

```java
// Code shown above
```

### ❓ Interview Questions

1. **Q:** What if session-scoped bean is not serializable?
   **A:** It’ll break if sessions are distributed; recommended to implement `Serializable`.
2. **Q:** How long does a session-scoped bean live?
   **A:** From first request to session timeout/invalidation.
3. **Q:** Can session beans be lazy-initialized?
   **A:** Yes, by combining `@Lazy` or provider-based injections.

---

## 6. Demo of @ApplicationScope inside School Web Application

### Real-Time Use-Case Example

```java
// Shared across all sessions/users
@ApplicationScope
@Component
class SchoolStats {
  private AtomicInteger totalTeachers = new AtomicInteger(), totalStudents = new AtomicInteger();

  void addTeacher() { totalTeachers.incrementAndGet(); }
  void addStudent() { totalStudents.incrementAndGet(); }
  Map<String,Integer> getStats() { return Map.of("teachers", totalTeachers.get(), "students", totalStudents.get()); }
}

@RestController
class SchoolController {
  @Autowired private SchoolStats stats;

  @GetMapping("/addTeacher") public String t() { stats.addTeacher(); return stats.getStats().toString(); }
  @GetMapping("/addStudent") public String s() { stats.addStudent(); return stats.getStats().toString(); }
}
```

### 🔍 5 Bullet-Point Explanations

* Single instance across servlet context.
* Thread-safe via `AtomicInteger`.
* Good for global app-wide metrics.
* Survives controller reloads; dies only on app/server restart.
* Useful for caching data like lookup tables or counters.

### ✏️ 5-Line Summary

The `@ApplicationScope` bean provides a single shared instance across the entire servlet context, suitable for system-wide metrics or caches. In the school app, it counts teachers and students globally. When implementing it, use thread-safe constructs like `AtomicInteger`. It persists for the duration of the web app deployment and cleans up on restart, enabling efficient shared state.

```java
// Code shown above
```

### ❓ Interview Questions

1. **Q:** Difference between `@Singleton` and `@ApplicationScope`?
   **A:** Both have one instance—but `@ApplicationScope` integrates with servlet context.
2. **Q:** Is `@ApplicationScope` thread-safe by default?
   **A:** No – you must use thread-safe types or synchronization.
3. **Q:** How to pre-load an application-scoped bean?
   **A:** Mark it `@Lazy(false)` or use `@PostConstruct` to trigger initialization at startup.

@SpringBootApplication
public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(App.class, args); } }

@Controller
public class HomeController {
  @GetMapping("/") public String home() { return "home"; }
  @GetMapping("/admin") public String admin() { return "admin"; }
}

@Configuration @EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
  @Override
  protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.authorizeRequests().antMatchers("/admin").authenticated()
        .anyRequest().permitAll()
        .and().formLogin();
  }
}
```

### 📝 5 Bullet-Point Explanations

* Enables Spring Security via `@EnableWebSecurity`.
* Secures `/admin` endpoint—requires login.
* Allows public access to home.
* Enables default login form for authentication.
* Defaults to in-memory user (`user`/auto-generated password).

### ✏️ 5-Line Summary

This configuration bootstraps Spring Security in a web app. It restricts access to `/admin`, allowing only authenticated users. Other endpoints remain publicly accessible. It uses the default login form and in-memory user with an auto-generated password. This demo illustrates basic secure setup with minimal code.

```java
// Full config shown above
```

### ❓ Interview Questions

1. **Q:** What is `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`?
   **A:** A convenience class for customizing web security configuration.
2. **Q:** What default user does Spring Security provide?
   **A:** A user named “user” with a random password logged in console.
3. **Q:** How does `formLogin()` work by default?
   **A:** Generates a login page at `/login`, authenticates using in-memory user.

---

## 2. Introduction to Spring Security

### Real-Time Use-Case Example

```java
@Configuration @EnableWebSecurity
public class BaseSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
  @Override
  protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.csrf().disable()
        .authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated()
        .and().httpBasic();
  }
}
```

### 📝 5 Bullet-Point Explanations

* Enables security via `@EnableWebSecurity`.
* Disables CSRF for simplified API access.
* Requires authentication for all requests.
* Uses HTTP Basic auth for simplicity.
* Integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot auto-config.

### ✏️ 5-Line Summary

Spring Security is a highly customizable security framework for authentication and authorization. By defining a `SecurityConfig` and enabling web security, it intercepts requests and enforces rules. It supports multiple auth mechanisms (Basic, JWT, Form, OAuth2). It also middleware features like CSRF protection and session management. This example introduces the foundation of Spring Security.

```java
// Configuration shown above
```

### ❓ Interview Questions

1. **Q:** What is the role of Spring Security's filter chain?
   **A:** Intercepts HTTP requests for security processing (authentication/authorization).
2. **Q:** Why disable CSRF in API contexts?
   **A:** APIs often stateless; CSRF is relevant for stateful sessions.
3. **Q:** What is HTTP Basic authentication?
   **A:** A simple header-based auth method sending username/password encoded in Base64.

---

## 3. Deep Dive: Authentication vs Authorization

### Real-Time Use-Case Example

```java
@Configuration @EnableWebSecurity
public class AuthConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
  @Override
  protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
    auth.inMemoryAuthentication()
        .withUser("user").password("{noop}pass").roles("USER")
        .and().withUser("admin").password("{noop}pass").roles("ADMIN");
  }

  @Override
  protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.authorizeRequests()
        .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
        .antMatchers("/user/**").authenticated()
        .and().formLogin();
  }
}
```

### 📝 5 Bullet-Point Explanations

* Authentication verifies who the user is.
* Authorization checks if the user has access rights.
* Defines two users: USER and ADMIN.
* Restricts `/admin/**` to ADMIN only.
* `/user/**` accessible to any authenticated user.

### ✏️ 5-Line Summary

Authentication confirms identity (login), while authorization determines permissions post-login. In Spring Security, you configure auth users/roles, then assign access rules based on roles. The code defines two roles and restricts endpoints accordingly. This separation ensures proper access control in web applications. AuthN and AuthZ are fundamental pillars of secure design.

```java
// Full configuration shown above
```

### ❓ Interview Questions

1. **Q:** What’s the difference between `hasRole` and `hasAuthority`?
   **A:** `hasRole("ADMIN")` checks for authority `ROLE_ADMIN`, `hasAuthority` checks any granted authority string.
2. **Q:** How are user credentials stored/validated?
   **A:** Via in-memory, JDBC, LDAP, OAuth, etc., defined in `AuthenticationManagerBuilder`.
3. **Q:** What happens after authentication in Spring Security?
   **A:** A `SecurityContext` with `Authentication` object is stored in session or thread-local.

## 4. Demo of Spring Security inside Web App with Default Behavior

### Real-Time Use-Case Example

```java
@SpringBootApplication public class DemoApp { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(DemoApp.class); } }

@RestController public class ApiController {
  @GetMapping("/api") public String api() { return "Hello API"; }
}
```

*(No custom security config)*

### 📝 5 Bullet-Point Explanations

* Spring Boot auto-configures default security.
* All endpoints require login.
* Login page provided at `/login`.
* In-memory user is auto-generated.
* Console logs the auto-generated password at startup.

### ✏️ 5-Line Summary

Without a custom config, Spring Boot sets up basic security by default: all endpoints are protected, and a default login form is provided. An in-memory user named "user" with a random password is auto-generated. This gives instant protection to new apps. Developers must override default to customize security behavior or open access to certain paths.

```java
// No custom config needed
```

### ❓ Interview Questions

1. **Q:** What is Spring Boot’s default security behavior?
   **A:** Secures all endpoints, provides login form, and auto-generates credentials.
2. **Q:** Where does the default password appear?
   **A:** In application console logs at startup.
3. **Q:** How to disable default form login?
   **A:** Define custom `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` or set `spring.autoconfigure.exclude=SecurityAutoConfiguration`.

## 5. Configure Custom Credentials inside Spring Security

### Real-Time Use-Case Example

```java
@Configuration @EnableWebSecurity
public class CustomAuthConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
  @Override
  protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
    auth.inMemoryAuthentication()
        .withUser("john").password("{noop}1234").roles("USER")
        .and()
        .withUser("admin").password("{noop}admin").roles("ADMIN");
  }

  @Override
  protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated()
        .and().formLogin();
  }
}
```

### ✅ 5 Bullet-Point Explanations

* Custom in-memory users are configured with specific credentials.
* `password("{noop}...")` indicates plain-text (no encoding).
* The form login will now accept `john/1234` or `admin/admin`.
* All endpoints require authentication due to `anyRequest().authenticated()`.
* Useful for demos, testing, or rapid prototyping.

### ✏️ 5-Line Summary

Spring Security allows customizing authentication with in-memory users. Developers can define specific usernames, passwords, and roles directly in the configuration. The `{noop}` prefix tells Spring to not encode the password. This is suitable for development or testing—not recommended for production. It helps validate access control setups early.

```java
// Full code above
```

### ❓ Interview Questions

1. **Q:** What does `{noop}` mean in a password?
   **A:** It tells Spring not to encode the password—used for plain text (not secure).
2. **Q:** How to store credentials more securely?
   **A:** Use `BCryptPasswordEncoder` or external authentication providers.
3. **Q:** Can we use both in-memory and database authentication?
   **A:** Yes, configure a composite `AuthenticationManager`.

---

## 6. IMPORTANT NOTE about Spring Security

### Real-Time Use-Case Example

No code required, conceptual note.

### 📌 5 Bullet-Point Explanations

* Spring Security protects **all endpoints** by default unless explicitly overridden.
* Passwords must be encoded unless using `{noop}` (development only).
* The filter chain order matters—declarations apply in top-down order.
* Always enable CSRF protection in forms unless using REST APIs.
* Incorrect security configurations can lock you out of your own app.

### ✏️ 5-Line Summary

Spring Security is powerful but must be configured carefully. It secures endpoints by default and enforces encoding of credentials. Misconfiguration can lead to inaccessible endpoints or insecure systems. It’s critical to understand how filters and rules are applied. Always test and document your security layers thoroughly.

### ❓ Interview Questions

1. **Q:** What happens if you don’t provide password encoder?
   **A:** Spring throws an error unless `{noop}` is used.
2. **Q:** Why might you be locked out after configuring security?
   **A:** Misconfigured paths or missing login page setup.
3. **Q:** What’s the role of CSRF protection in Spring Security?
   **A:** Prevents malicious third-party sites from executing actions as authenticated users.

---

## 7. Understanding Default Security Configurations in Spring

### Real-Time Use-Case Example

```java
// No configuration necessary for this example
@RestController
public class DefaultSecuredController {
  @GetMapping("/secure") public String secure() { return "Secure area"; }
}
```

### 🔍 5 Bullet-Point Explanations

* Without config, `/secure` requires authentication.
* Default user: `user`, password in logs.
* Login form available at `/login`.
* CSRF is enabled by default.
* Security auto-config can be customized or disabled.

### ✏️ 5-Line Summary

Spring Boot’s auto-configuration includes security by default. This means endpoints are secured and require login with a default user. It encourages secure-by-default development. You can customize or disable it using configuration classes or `application.properties`. Understanding this behavior is key for debugging access issues.

### ❓ Interview Questions

1. **Q:** What’s included in default Spring Boot security?
   **A:** Auto-login page, one in-memory user, CSRF enabled, all endpoints secured.
2. **Q:** Where does the auto-generated password appear?
   **A:** In the console logs during app startup.
3. **Q:** How to disable default security in dev mode?
   **A:** Override config or exclude `SecurityAutoConfiguration`.

## 8. Configure `permitAll()` inside Web App using Spring Security

### Real-Time Use-Case Example

```java
@Configuration @EnableWebSecurity
public class PermitAllConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
  @Override
  protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.authorizeRequests()
        .antMatchers("/", "/about").permitAll()
        .anyRequest().authenticated()
        .and().formLogin();
  }
}
```

### ✅ 5 Bullet-Point Explanations

* `/` and `/about` are open to everyone.
* Other URLs require authentication.
* `permitAll()` overrides the global authentication rule.
* Useful for login, signup, and public pages.
* Enhances user experience by allowing guest access.

### ✏️ 5-Line Summary

`permitAll()` in Spring Security explicitly allows access to certain endpoints without authentication. It’s commonly used for login pages, home pages, or info sections. In contrast, `authenticated()` ensures all other routes are protected. This separation creates clear boundaries between public and protected parts of an app.

```java
// See code above
```

### ❓ Interview Questions

1. **Q:** Can `permitAll()` be used with `formLogin()`?
   **A:** Yes, it allows specific pages to bypass login.
2. **Q:** What happens if you use `permitAll()` for `/admin`?
   **A:** `/admin` becomes accessible without authentication.
3. **Q:** What’s the difference between `permitAll()` and `anonymous()`?
   **A:** `permitAll()` allows everyone; `anonymous()` allows only unauthenticated users.

---

## 9. Configure `denyAll()` inside Web App using Spring Security

### Real-Time Use-Case Example

```java
@Configuration @EnableWebSecurity
public class DenyAllConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
  @Override
  protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.authorizeRequests()
        .antMatchers("/maintenance").denyAll()
        .anyRequest().permitAll()
        .and().formLogin();
  }
}
```

### 🔒 5 Bullet-Point Explanations

* `/maintenance` is blocked for **all** users.
* No user, authenticated or not, can access it.
* Useful for disabling routes temporarily.
* Applies even to admin users.
* Overrides any global permissions.

### ✏️ 5-Line Summary

`denyAll()` is a powerful way to block access to any endpoint, for all users. It is useful for maintenance routes, deprecated APIs, or temporarily disabled features. No role or authentication can bypass it. Use it cautiously, as it overrides other access rules. It ensures controlled and predictable shutdowns of services.

```java
// Configuration shown above
```

### ❓ Interview Questions

1. **Q:** When would you use `denyAll()`?
   **A:** To disable a feature or route temporarily or permanently.
2. **Q:** Can `denyAll()` be combined with roles?
   **A:** No, it blocks all users regardless of role.
3. **Q:** What if you place `denyAll()` after `permitAll()`?
   **A:** Order matters—first match applies.

## 10. Configure Custom Security Configurations using Spring Security

### Real-Time Use-Case Example

```java
@Configuration @EnableWebSecurity
public class RoleBasedConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
  @Override
  protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
    auth.inMemoryAuthentication()
        .withUser("admin").password("{noop}admin").roles("ADMIN")
        .and()
        .withUser("user").password("{noop}user").roles("USER");
  }

  @Override
  protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.authorizeRequests()
        .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
        .antMatchers("/user/**").hasAnyRole("USER", "ADMIN")
        .antMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
        .and().formLogin();
  }
}
```

### 🎯 5 Bullet-Point Explanations

* Configures custom users with roles USER and ADMIN.
* Protects `/admin/**` strictly for ADMIN.
* `/user/**` accessible to both roles.
* `/public/**` open for all users.
* Demonstrates role-based access control.

### ✏️ 5-Line Summary

Custom security configurations in Spring Security allow role-based access to resources. You can define fine-grained access controls using `hasRole()`, `hasAnyRole()`, and `permitAll()`. This enables clear separation between admin, user, and public areas. This setup demonstrates how real-world apps can structure access based on roles.

```java
// Full configuration above
```

### ❓ Interview Questions

1. **Q:** What’s the difference between `hasRole()` and `hasAnyRole()`?
   **A:** `hasRole()` checks one role; \`hasAnyRole


()`checks multiple roles.   2. **Q:** Can one user have multiple roles?      **A:** Yes, assign multiple roles using`.roles("ADMIN", "USER")\`.
3\. **Q:** How to secure REST APIs differently?
**A:** Use token-based auth (e.g., JWT) and stateless security configs.

### 4. Exception Handling using `@ControllerAdvice` & `@ExceptionHandler`

#### ✅ Use-case Example

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
  @ExceptionHandler(EntityNotFoundException.class)
  public ResponseEntity<String> handleNotFound(EntityNotFoundException ex) {
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).body(ex.getMessage());
  }
}
```

#### 🔍 5 Bullet-point Explanations

* 🧩 **Global scope**: `@ControllerAdvice` applies across all controllers.
* 🎯 **Exception routing**: `@ExceptionHandler` maps exception types to handlers.
* 🛠️ **Custom responses**: Handle exceptions with specific HTTP codes and messages.
* ✂️ **Separation of concerns**: Keeps controllers clean from error-handling logic.
* ⚙️ **Broad capability**: Supports multiple exception types or a generic handler.

#### 🔚 Summary (5 lines)

Using `@ControllerAdvice` with `@ExceptionHandler` centralizes error handling in Spring MVC. It intercepts unchecked and custom exceptions thrown by any controller, allowing you to return standardized HTTP statuses and messages. This improves maintainability, eliminating repetitive try/catch blocks. You can define handlers per exception type or a generic fallback. It enables a cleaner separation between business logic and error handling.

#### 💻 Code at End of Summary

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
  @ExceptionHandler(EntityNotFoundException.class)
  public ResponseEntity<String> handleNotFound(EntityNotFoundException ex) {
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).body(ex.getMessage());
  }
}
```

#### 🧠 Interview Q\&A

1. **Q: What does `@ControllerAdvice` do?**
   **A:** It marks a class as a global exception handler across all controllers.

2. **Q: How do you handle multiple exception types in one method?**
   **A:** List them in `@ExceptionHandler({TypeA.class, TypeB.class})`.

3. **Q: What if an exception isn’t handled explicitly?**
   **A:** It falls back to default Spring behavior—typically HTTP 500 with stack trace or generic message.

### 5. Introduction to `@ControllerAdvice` & `@ExceptionHandler` annotations

#### ✅ Use-case Example

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class ApiErrorHandler {
  @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class)
  public ResponseEntity<Map<String,String>> handleValidation(MethodArgumentNotValidException ex) {
    Map<String,String> errors = ex.getBindingResult().getFieldErrors()
      .stream().collect(Collectors.toMap(e->e.getField(), DefaultMessageSourceResolvable::getDefaultMessage));
    return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(errors);
  }
}
```

#### 🔍 5 Bullet-point Explanations

* 🌍 **Central hub**: `@ControllerAdvice` consolidates global behaviors like validation handling.
* 🧪 **Validator exceptions**: Handles form binding errors automatically.
* 📄 **Structured feedback**: Returns field-level error details to clients.
* 🎭 **Reusability**: Applies across multiple controllers or endpoints.
* 🛡️ **Consistency**: Ensures uniform error format for front-end or API clients.

#### 🔚 Summary (5 lines)

These annotations enable centralized exception handling in Spring apps. `@ControllerAdvice` identifies a global handler class, while `@ExceptionHandler` denotes methods handling specific exceptions. They enhance consistency and reduce repetitive code in controllers. Ideal for handling validation, access errors, business exceptions, etc. They enable returning structured HTTP responses (e.g., JSON error payloads).

#### 💻 Code at End of Summary

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class ApiErrorHandler {
  @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class)
  public ResponseEntity<Map<String,String>> handleValidation(MethodArgumentNotValidException ex) {
    Map<String,String> errors = ex.getBindingResult().getFieldErrors()
      .stream().collect(Collectors.toMap(e->e.getField(), DefaultMessageSourceResolvable::getDefaultMessage));
    return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(errors);
  }
}
```

#### 🧠 Interview Q\&A

1. **Q: Can `@ControllerAdvice` be made to only apply to certain controllers?**
   **A:** Yes—you can limit scope using attributes like `basePackages` or assignable types.

2. **Q: How do you send a custom HTTP status from an exception handler?**
   **A:** Return a `ResponseEntity<T>` with your desired `HttpStatus`.

3. **Q: What’s the order of exception handlers if multiple match?**
   **A:** Spring chooses the most specific exception type first, then broader ones.

### 6. Demo of `@ControllerAdvice` & `@ExceptionHandler` annotations

#### ✅ Use-case Example

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class RestExceptionHandler {
  @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
  public ResponseEntity<Map<String,String>> genericHandler(Exception ex) {
    Map<String,String> error = Map.of("error", "Internal error", "details", ex.getMessage());
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).body(error);
  }
}
```

#### 🔍 5 Bullet-point Explanations

* 📦 **Catch-all handler**: Handles any uncaught exceptions.
* 🧽 **Sanitize output**: Masks internal stack traces, avoids exposing sensitive data.
* 📦 **JSON structure**: Provides consistent error payload.
* 🔁 **Logging integration**: You can log inside handler before sending response.
* 🔧 **Developer mode**: Expand detail in dev, narrow in prod.

#### 🔚 Summary (5 lines)

This demo shows a catch-all exception handler using `Exception.class`. It's useful to ensure your API doesn’t leak stack traces and returns a clean, consistent error response. Combined with more specific handlers, it forms a robust exception handling hierarchy. Useful for logging and differentiating between client vs internal errors. Helps both dev and production environments.

#### 💻 Code at End of Summary

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class RestExceptionHandler {
  @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
  public ResponseEntity<Map<String,String>> genericHandler(Exception ex) {
    Map<String,String> error = Map.of("error", "Internal error", "details", ex.getMessage());
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).body(error);
  }
}
```

#### 🧠 Interview Q\&A

1. **Q: How do you avoid exposing internal errors to clients?**
   **A:** Use a generic handler for `Exception.class` that hides stack details.

2. **Q: Should you catch `Error` or `Throwable`?**
   **A:** No—catching those is too broad; focus on `Exception` or specific subtypes.

3. **Q: How do you log exceptions in `@ExceptionHandler`?**
   **A:** Use a logger (e.g., SLF4J) inside the method, then return a user-safe response.

---

### 8. **Implement CSRF Fix inside Web App - Spring Security Part 2**

#### ✅ Use-case Example (HTML form + CSRF token)

```html
<form method="post" action="/submit">
  <input type="text" name="data">
  <input type="hidden" th:name="${_csrf.parameterName}" th:value="${_csrf.token}">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

```java
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
  http
    .csrf().csrfTokenRepository(CookieCsrfTokenRepository.withHttpOnlyFalse())
    .and()
    .authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated()
    .and().formLogin();
}
```

#### 🔍 5 Bullet-point Explanations

* 🔐 **Token inclusion**: Insert CSRF token in all POST/PUT/DELETE forms.
* 🍪 **Cookie-based token**: `CookieCsrfTokenRepository` stores the token in a cookie.
* 🔁 **Client-side access**: `HttpOnlyFalse` allows JavaScript to read token if needed.
* ✅ **Form compatibility**: Thymeleaf and JSP automatically handle CSRF fields if configured.
* 🧪 **Test-ready**: Ensures full-cycle CSRF protection in form submissions.

#### 🔚 Summary (5 lines)

To fix CSRF in web apps, you ensure the token is included in each modifying request. Using `CookieCsrfTokenRepository`, Spring writes the CSRF token to a cookie, which you read and submit with each request. Thymeleaf and Spring auto-inject tokens into forms. JavaScript apps must manually read the cookie and add the token to headers. This setup hardens the app against CSRF attacks.

#### 💻 Code at End of Summary

```java
http.csrf().csrfTokenRepository(CookieCsrfTokenRepository.withHttpOnlyFalse());
```

#### 🧠 Interview Q\&A

1. **Q: Why use `CookieCsrfTokenRepository`?**
   **A:** It allows CSRF token to be sent in cookies and accessed by JS-based apps like React/Angular.

2. **Q: Can the CSRF token be stored in a session?**
   **A:** Yes, the default repository stores it in the session.

3. **Q: Is CSRF required for GET requests?**
   **A:** No, CSRF protection is only needed for state-changing requests (POST, PUT, DELETE).

---

### 9. **Deep Dive of CSRF Attack**

#### ✅ Real-World Scenario

A user logs into a banking site. While logged in, they visit a malicious website that auto-submits a form to `https://bank.com/transfer` without the user knowing. Since the browser auto-sends cookies, the request appears legitimate.

#### 🔍 5 Bullet-point Explanations

* 🎯 **Targeted at authenticated users**: CSRF exploits active login sessions.
* 📦 **Leverages cookies**: Browser auto-sends session cookies.
* ❌ **Invisible form submission**: Often via hidden forms or auto-submitting JS.
* 🛡️ **No JavaScript execution on the original domain**: It’s not XSS.
* 🔒 **Spring defends via CSRF tokens**: Tokens must be part of POST/PUT/DELETE.

#### 🔚 Summary (5 lines)

CSRF attacks trick a logged-in user’s browser into sending unauthorized requests. The malicious site relies on browser behavior to send session cookies with the request. Because the browser is trusted, the server believes the request is genuine. CSRF tokens ensure the request originated from your site. This is why token verification is critical for secure state-changing operations.

#### 💻 Example of Malicious Request

```html
<form action="https://bank.com/transfer" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="10000">
  <input type="hidden" name="toAccount" value="attacker123">
  <input type="submit">
</form>
<script>document.forms[0].submit();</script>
```

#### 🧠 Interview Q\&A

1. **Q: What makes CSRF different from XSS?**
   **A:** CSRF exploits trusted users; XSS exploits trust in user-supplied content.

2. **Q: Why does CSRF require a logged-in session?**
   **A:** The attack relies on the browser sending valid authentication cookies.

3. **Q: How can SameSite cookies help?**
   **A:** Cookies with `SameSite=Strict` or `Lax` are not sent on cross-site requests, preventing CSRF.

---

### 10. **Solution for CSRF Attack - Theory**

#### 🔍 5 Bullet-point Explanations

* 🔐 **CSRF tokens**: Unpredictable value included in every modifying request.
* 🍪 **Token tied to session**: CSRF token must match the user session.
* 🔁 **Valid only once**: Optional rotation strategy enhances security.
* ⚙️ **Enforced by server**: Request is rejected if token is missing/invalid.
* 💡 **Stateless APIs use JWT or OAuth**: CSRF less of a concern in token-auth APIs.

#### 🔚 Summary (5 lines)

The solution to CSRF involves verifying a unique token for each user session on every state‑changing request. The server compares this token with its expected value. If missing or incorrect, the request is blocked. This prevents malicious third-party sites from executing unwanted actions on behalf of the user. For REST APIs, the use of tokens like JWT avoids CSRF altogether when cookies are not used.

#### 💻 Code (Conceptual)

```java
http.csrf().csrfTokenRepository(CookieCsrfTokenRepository.withHttpOnlyFalse());
```

#### 🧠 Interview Q\&A

1. **Q: Is CSRF a concern in token-based APIs?**
   **A:** Generally no, if the token is sent via headers, not cookies.

2. **Q: Can HTTPS prevent CSRF?**
   **A:** No, HTTPS only ensures encryption—not request origin integrity.

3. **Q: What makes a CSRF token secure?**
   **A:** It should be unique, unpredictable, and tied to the user session.

---

### 11. **Solution for CSRF Attack - Coding**

#### ✅ Example Code

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class CsrfFixConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
  @Override
  protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
      .csrf().csrfTokenRepository(CookieCsrfTokenRepository.withHttpOnlyFalse())
      .and()
      .authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated()
      .and()
      .formLogin();
  }
}
```

#### 🔍 5 Bullet-point Explanations

* ✅ **Enable CSRF with token repo**: Uses cookies to share token with front-end.
* 🍪 **HttpOnly false**: Allows JS frameworks to read the token and set it in headers.
* 🧪 **Form-safe**: Backed automatically into Thymeleaf/JSP forms.
* 📦 **Complete fix**: Ensures protection against real-world CSRF vectors.
* 🔐 **Secure integration**: Works well with Angular, React, etc.

#### 🔚 Summary (5 lines)

Implementing CSRF protection using `CookieCsrfTokenRepository` integrates well with modern front-end frameworks. Tokens are stored in cookies and sent in headers or form fields. Spring validates the token for each modifying request. If the token is missing or invalid, it blocks the action. This setup guards against CSRF while supporting SPA frameworks.

#### 💻 Code at End of Summary

```java
http.csrf().csrfTokenRepository(CookieCsrfTokenRepository.withHttpOnlyFalse());
```

#### 🧠 Interview Q\&A

1. **Q: How do you support React/Angular apps with CSRF?**
   **A:** Store the token in a cookie and require the client to include it in the request headers.

2. **Q: What happens if CSRF token is missing in a POST request?**
   **A:** Spring returns a 403 Forbidden error.

3. **Q: Can you customize the token header name?**
   **A:** Yes, using `CsrfTokenRepository.setHeaderName("X-CUSTOM-CSRF")`.

## **4. Introduction to JDBC & Problems with It**

### ✅ Real-Time Use Case

You’re working on a legacy Java application that uses raw JDBC for database communication. You must manage SQL execution manually, including connection setup, error handling, and resource management.

### 🔍 Key Points

* **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)** is a low-level API for database access.
* **Manages database connection, statement, and result set manually**.
* **Error-prone and verbose**, especially with exception handling.
* **Requires boilerplate code** for even simple operations.
* **Lacks built-in object mapping** to Java classes.

### 📝 Summary

JDBC is the foundational API that allows Java applications to communicate with relational databases using SQL. However, it comes with downsides like verbosity, manual resource handling, and lack of abstraction. Developers must write a lot of repetitive code for even basic operations, making it error-prone and hard to maintain in large applications.

### 💻 Code Example

```java
Connection conn = null;
PreparedStatement stmt = null;

try {
    conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:h2:mem:testdb", "sa", "");
    stmt = conn.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO contact_message (name, email, message) VALUES (?, ?, ?)");
    stmt.setString(1, "John Doe");
    stmt.setString(2, "john@example.com");
    stmt.setString(3, "Test message");
    stmt.executeUpdate();
} catch (SQLException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
    try { if (stmt != null) stmt.close(); } catch (Exception e) {}
    try { if (conn != null) conn.close(); } catch (Exception e) {}
}
```

---

### 👔 Interview Questions

1. **Q:** What is JDBC used for?
   **A:** It is used for executing SQL statements and managing database communication in Java.

2. **Q:** What are common problems with using JDBC directly?
   **A:** Verbosity, manual resource handling, lack of abstraction, and risk of SQL injection.

3. **Q:** Is JDBC object-oriented or procedural?
   **A:** It follows a procedural style with less abstraction.

---

## **5. Introduction to Spring JDBC**

### ✅ Real-Time Use Case

You're migrating a monolithic app that uses raw JDBC. To simplify your data access layer, you decide to use **Spring JDBC**, which reduces boilerplate and provides better exception handling.

### 🔍 Key Points

* **Wraps raw JDBC** with simplified operations.
* **Uses JdbcTemplate** to abstract repetitive code.
* **Integrates smoothly with Spring Boot** via dependency injection.
* **Provides cleaner exception hierarchy** using `DataAccessException`.
* **Still uses SQL**, giving you fine control over queries.

### 📝 Summary

Spring JDBC is a thin layer over JDBC that simplifies database operations using the `JdbcTemplate` class. It minimizes boilerplate, provides better exception translation, and integrates well with Spring’s dependency injection. It allows developers to use raw SQL when needed while making code more readable and maintainable.

### 💻 Code Example

   **A:** No, it’s a simpler alternative for apps not needing full ORM capabilities.

---

## **6. Saving Contact Message Using JdbcTemplate Insert Operation**

### ✅ Real-Time Use Case

You have a contact form in your application. When a user submits a message, you need to persist it into an H2 database using a JDBC insert query.

### 🔍 Key Points

* **Uses `JdbcTemplate.update()`** for insert operations.
* **Maps input fields directly to SQL parameters**.
* **Returns number of affected rows** (useful for validation).
* **Faster than JPA** for simple insert operations.
* **Good for applications needing performance & control**.

### 📝 Summary

`JdbcTemplate`'s `update()` method is ideal for inserting records into a database. You pass the SQL string with placeholders and corresponding values. It's lightweight, avoids ORM complexity, and gives immediate control over SQL syntax. This method is perfect for basic CRUD operations like contact form submissions.

### 💻 Code Example

```java
@Service
public class ContactService {

    @Autowired
    private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

    public String saveContact(String name, String email, String message) {
        int rows = jdbcTemplate.update(
            "INSERT INTO contact_message (name, email, message) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
            name, email, message
        );
        return rows == 1 ? "Saved successfully" : "Failed to save";
    }
}
```

---

### 👔 Interview Questions

1. **Q:** What method is used to insert records using JdbcTemplate?
   **A:** `update()`.

2. **Q:** What is returned by JdbcTemplate’s `update()` method?
   **A:** The number of rows affected.

3. **Q:** How does JdbcTemplate prevent SQL injection?

✅ **Up Next:** Would you like me to cover the remaining:

* **Display Contact Messages using JdbcTemplate (Select Part 1 & 2)**
* **Update Contact Messages using JdbcTemplate (Update)**
* **Implementing AOP in a Web Application**

Here are four detailed sections covering real-time use case examples, followed by sample code and relevant interview Q\&A for each topic:

---

## 1. Display Contact messages from DB using JdbcTemplate select operation - Part 1

### ✅ Use Case & Explanation

* ✅ Load all incoming contact messages marked as `NEW` from the DB for frontline support.
* ✅ Map each row into a `ContactMessage` model via a RowMapper.
* ✅ Leverage `JdbcTemplate.query(...)` to retrieve multiple rows.
* ✅ Populate a list and return to a service or REST endpoint.
* ✅ Handle `EmptyResultDataAccessException` to avoid null return.

### 📋 Summary (5 lines)

You’ll use `JdbcTemplate` to run a SELECT statement fetching all new contact messages. A `RowMapper` converts each row into a `ContactMessage` POJO. The `query()` call cleanly returns a `List<ContactMessage>`. Edge cases like no new messages are handled via exceptions. This forms a robust service layer foundation.

```java
public List<ContactMessage> fetchNewMessages() {
    String sql = "SELECT id, name, email, message, status FROM contact_messages WHERE status = ?";
    return jdbcTemplate.query(
        sql,
        new Object[]{ "NEW" },
        (rs, rowNum) -> new ContactMessage(
            rs.getLong("id"),
            rs.getString("name"),
            rs.getString("email"),
            rs.getString("message"),
            rs.getString("status")
        )
    );
}
```

### ❓ Interview Questions

1. **Q**: Why use `query()` instead of `queryForObject()` for multi-row results?
   **A**: `query()` returns a `List` and handles multiple rows; `queryForObject()` expects exactly one row and throws an exception if zero or more than one row is returned.

2. **Q**: What is a `RowMapper` and why use it?
   **A**: A `RowMapper` is a callback interface that converts a JDBC `ResultSet` row into a model object. It decouples DB schema details from domain logic.

3. **Q**: How do you handle no results in `query()`?
   **A**: `query()` returns an empty list if there are no matches. An `EmptyResultDataAccessException` is only thrown when using methods like `queryForObject()`.

---

## 2. Display Contact messages from DB using JdbcTemplate select operation - Part 2

### ✅ Use Case & Explanation

* ✅ Fetch messages with pagination parameters (`OFFSET`, `LIMIT`).
* ✅ Accept `page` and `size` to navigate history in admin UI.
* ✅ Map each row to `ContactMessage` model via `RowMapper`.
* ✅ Return result set plus total count.
* ✅ Protect against SQL injection via parameterized queries.

### 📋 Summary (5 lines)

Here we'll implement pagination using `JdbcTemplate`. We run one query for total record count and another with `LIMIT ? OFFSET ?`. We map rows to `ContactMessage` objects. We return a custom `PagedResult<ContactMessage>`. This supports efficient paged UIs for message browsing.

```java
public PagedResult<ContactMessage> fetchMessagesPage(int page, int size) {
    int offset = page * size;
    String sqlList = "SELECT id, name, email, message, status FROM contact_messages ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT ? OFFSET ?";
    String sqlCount = "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM contact_messages";
    List<ContactMessage> rows = jdbcTemplate.query(
        sqlList,
        new Object[]{ size, offset },
        (rs, rn) -> new ContactMessage(rs.getLong("id"), rs.getString("name"),
                rs.getString("email"), rs.getString("message"), rs.getString("status"))
    );
    int total = jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(sqlCount, Integer.class);
    return new PagedResult<>(rows, page, size, total);
}
```

### ❓ Interview Questions

1. **Q**: How do you avoid SQL injection in pagination?
   **A**: By using parameterized queries (`?`) instead of string concatenation for `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`.

2. **Q**: Why run a separate count query?
   **A**: To provide total record count for pagination metadata (total pages, navigational info).

3. **Q**: What model structure do you use for paged results?
   **A**: A `PagedResult<T>` class containing `List<T> items`, `int page`, `int size`, `int totalItems`, etc.

## 3. Update Contact messages status using JdbcTemplate update operation

### ✅ Use Case & Explanation

* ✅ Mark messages as `READ` after support responds.
* ✅ Use `JdbcTemplate.update(...)` to change status based on `id`.
* ✅ Return count of affected rows for verification.
* ✅ Trigger downstream logic (notifications, audit).
* ✅ Wrap in transaction for atomicity if other DB actions included.

### 📋 Summary (5 lines)

This updates the status of a specific contact message using `JdbcTemplate.update()`. It takes an `id` and the new `status` value. The method returns how many rows were affected—ensuring the update occurred. You may wrap this in a transaction if doing multiple related operations too.

```java
@Transactional
public boolean markMessageRead(long id) {
    String sql = "UPDATE contact_messages SET status = ? WHERE id = ?";
    int updated = jdbcTemplate.update(sql, "READ", id);
    return updated == 1;
}
```

### ❓ Interview Questions

1. **Q**: What does `jdbcTemplate.update()` return?
   **A**: The number of rows affected by the update operation.

2. **Q**: Why annotate with `@Transactional`?
   **A**: To ensure all DB changes succeed or roll back together when part of a larger operation.

3. **Q**: How do you handle stale or missing rows?
   **A**: Check the return value; if zero, return false or throw an exception indicating the row didn’t exist.

## 4. Implementing AOP Web Application

### ✅ Use Case & Explanation

* ✅ Log entry/exit of all controller methods using AOP.
* ✅ Measure execution time and log warnings if slow.
* ✅ Apply security checks (e.g., RBAC) via AOP before method execution.
* ✅ Use `@Around` advice to wrap performance-critical operations.
* ✅ Handle exceptions uniformly using `@AfterThrowing`.

### 📋 Summary (5 lines)

You can use Spring AOP to separate cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and performance metrics from business logic. Define an aspect with `@Aspect`, and annotate methods or classes to intercept. Use `@Before`, `@Around`, and `@AfterThrowing` to inject behavior at various join points. This keeps controllers clean and improves maintainability.

```java
@Aspect @Component
public class LoggingAspect {
    @Around("execution(* com.example.app.controller.*.*(..))")
    public Object logAndTime(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp) throws Throwable {
        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
        try {
            return pjp.proceed();
        } finally {
            long elapsed = System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
            String method = pjp.getSignature().toShortString();
            if (elapsed > 1000) logger.warn("{} took {} ms", method, elapsed);
            else logger.info("{} took {} ms", method, elapsed);
        }
    }
}
```

### ❓ Interview Questions

1. **Q**: What is AOP and why use it?
   **A**: Aspect-Oriented Programming modularizes cross-cutting concerns (logging, security) to keep business code clean and reusable.

2. **Q**: What’s the difference between `@Before` and `@Around` advice?
   **A**: `@Before` runs before join point, cannot alter return or catch exceptions; `@Around` wraps the call, can control execution and handle return/exception.

3. **Q**: How do you ensure AOP gets applied (proxy issues)?
   **A**: Ensure `@EnableAspectJAutoProxy` is enabled, beans are managed by Spring, and you’re not invoking methods within the same class directly (due to proxy limitations).

3. **Q**: How do you customize a query?
   **A**: Use `@Query` with JPQL/SQL or derived query method names.

---

## 2. **Deep dive on Repository hierarchy: Repository, CrudRepository, PagingAndSortingRepository, JpaRepository**

**Use‑Case**: Large-scale API needs advanced pagination and JPA features including batch save and flushing.

* 🔹 `Repository` – central marker interface, no methods
* 🔹 `CrudRepository` – basic CRUD ops (`save`, `findAll`, `delete`)
* 🔹 `PagingAndSortingRepository` – adds `Pageable` and `Sort`
* 🔹 `JpaRepository` – JPA-specific features (`flush`, batch deletes, `saveAndFlush`)
* 🔹 Interfaces are extendable; pick lowest common ancestor

**Summary**
The Spring Data repository hierarchy starts with the empty `Repository` interface, moves up to `CrudRepository` that provides CRUD, then to `PagingAndSortingRepository` for paging and sorting support, and finally `JpaRepository` which adds JPA-specific operations. You choose the interface based on needed features. This hierarchical design promotes clean abstraction and avoids including unnecessary methods.

```java
interface UserRepo extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
  Page<User> findByEmailContaining(String domain, Pageable p);
}
```

**Interview Qs & As**

1. **Q**: When should you use `PagingAndSortingRepository`?
   **A**: When you need pagination/sorting support beyond basic CRUD.
2. **Q**: What extra methods does `JpaRepository` add?
   **A**: `flush()`, `saveAndFlush()`, `deleteInBatch()`, `getOne()`.
3. **Q**: Is it okay to always use `JpaRepository`?
   **A**: Yes technically, but better to choose minimal interface to avoid bloat.

---

## 3. **Introduction to Spring Data JPA**

Spring Data JPA utilizes JPA implementations like Hibernate to interact with relational databases using repository interfaces. It provides derived queries, JPQL support, paging, and transactions, while Spring Boot setups connection, JPA vendor adapter, and entity scanning. It makes working with ORM easy and efficient.

```java
@Entity class Order { 
  @Id @GeneratedValue Long id; 
  Instant date; 
}

interface OrderRepo extends JpaRepository<Order, Long> {
  List<Order> findByDateAfter(Instant since);
}
```

**Interview Qs & As**

1. **Q**: How to define a repository for JPA?
   **A**: Extend `JpaRepository<Entity, ID>` and declare finder methods.
2. **Q**: How does Spring manage transactions?
   **A**: `@Transactional` is supported by Spring’s transaction manager wiring.
3. **Q**: How to run native SQL queries?
   **A**: Use `@Query(value="...", nativeQuery=true)`.

---

## 4. **Migrate from Spring JDBC to Spring Data JPA**

**Use‑Case**: Refactor an existing JDBC-based DAO to JPA repositories to simplify mapping and reduce boilerplate.

* 🔹 Replace `JdbcTemplate` usage with `JpaRepository`
* 🔹 Map SQL CRUD → derived query methods or `@Query`
* 🔹 Convert row-mapped objects to JPA entities with annotations
* 🔹 Remove manual transaction management; switch to `@Transactional`
* 🔹 Take advantage of cache, lazy loading, relationships

**Summary**
Migrating from JDBC to Spring Data JPA involves converting DAOs using `JdbcTemplate` and manual mapping into entity classes and repository interfaces. You map tables to JPA entities, define repository methods replacing CRUD SQL, remove boilerplate, and add `@Transactional`. The result is cleaner, more maintainable code with relational mapping support.

```java
@Entity class Customer {
  @Id Long id;
  String name;
}

interface CustomerRepo extends JpaRepository<Customer, Long> {
  List<Customer> findByNameStartingWith(String prefix);
}
```

**Interview Qs & As**

1. **Q**: What’s the first step migrating JDBC to JPA?

2. **Q**: How replace manual mapping?
   **A**: Use JPA annotations and let Hibernate generate SQL/mapping.
3. **Q**: How to handle relationships?
   **A**: Use `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, and proper fetch types.

---

## 5. **Deep dive on derived query methods inside Spring Data JPA**

**Use‑Case**: Need to write dynamic finder methods like retrieving users by age range and active status.

* 🔹 Method names parse into JPQL queries (`findByStatusAndAgeGreaterThan`)
* 🔹 Supports `And`, `Or`, `Between`, `LessThan`, `OrderBy`, `Like`, etc.
* 🔹 Uses keywords like `IgnoreCase`, `StartingWith`, `Containing`
* 🔹 Supports pagination via `findBy...(..., Pageable)`
* 🔹 You can combine with `@Query` for complex scenarios

**Summary**
Derived query methods allow you to define queries through method naming conventions. Spring Data JPA interprets those names and builds SQL accordingly. You can filter, sort, and page results without writing queries. It streamlines DAO implementation and improves readability.

```java
interface UserRepo extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
  List<User> findByStatusAndAgeBetweenOrderByJoinDateDesc(String status, int min, int max);
}
```

**Interview Qs & As**

1. **Q**: Explain a derived query method.
   **A**: It's a method whose name maps to a query (e.g., `findByEmailContaining`).
2. **Q**: How to add sorting?
   **A**: Use `OrderByFieldAsc/Desc` or pass `Sort`/`Pageable`.
3. **Q**: When to use `@Query` instead?
   **A**: For very complex or performance-tuned queries that derived methods can't express.

---

## 6. **“Introduction to Spring Data & Spring Data JPA”**

This topic spans the union of Spring Data's store-agnostic approach and JPA-specific enhancements. It’s effectively a summary, combining earlier points: reuse of repository DSL, support for multiple data stores, plus ORM capabilities, entity mapping, transactions, and query derivation.

**Use‑Case**: Your app persists both relational data (via JPA) and cache/NoSQL stores, and you want a consistent repository style.

* 🔹 You can grow the tech stack without rewriting repository logic
* 🔹 Access to powerful features like auditing, pagination, relationship mapping

**Summary (combined)**
Spring Data provides a template-style abstraction over data access methods, allowing you to define clean repository interfaces. Spring Data JPA specializes this abstraction for relational databases using JPA. You gain strong ORM features, derived queries, pagination, sorting, and integration with Spring-managed transactions. It’s an ideal combo for clean, maintainable, and extensible data-access layers.

```java
// Core entity
@Entity class Product { @Id Long id; String name; }

// JPA repository interface
interface ProductRepo extends JpaRepository<Product, Long> {
  Page<Product> findByNameContainingIgnoreCase(String q, Pageable p);
}
```

**Interview Qs & As**

1. **Q**: What’s the difference between Spring Data core and JPA?
   **A**: Core is store-agnostic repos, JPA adds ORM and JPA-specific methods.

## 5. Building Custom Validations inside Spring MVC

**Use-Case:**
You need to validate user input on registration forms with custom rules beyond standard annotations.

* 🔹 Implement `ConstraintValidator` interface for custom logic
* 🔹 Create a custom annotation for the validation
* 🔹 Use the annotation on DTO or model fields
* 🔹 Integrate with Spring MVC `@Valid` to trigger validation automatically
* 🔹 Provide meaningful error messages on validation failure

**Summary:**
Spring MVC supports custom validations by letting developers define their own annotations and validator classes. By implementing `ConstraintValidator` and creating annotations, you extend validation logic beyond built-in constraints. When used with `@Valid` and `BindingResult`, it allows seamless integration in controllers and UI forms.

```java
@Documented
@Constraint(validatedBy = PasswordConstraintValidator.class)
@Target({ElementType.FIELD})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface ValidPassword {
  String message() default "Invalid password";
  Class<?>[] groups() default {};
  Class<? extends Payload>[] payload() default {};
}

public class PasswordConstraintValidator implements ConstraintValidator<ValidPassword, String> {
  public boolean isValid(String password, ConstraintValidatorContext context) {
    return password != null && password.matches("^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z]).{6,}$");
  }
}
```

**Interview Qs & As:**

1. **Q:** How do you create a custom validation?
   **A:** Create annotation + implement `ConstraintValidator`.
2. **Q:** How to trigger validation in Spring MVC?
   **A:** Use `@Valid` on method parameters and `BindingResult` to check errors.
3. **Q:** How to customize error messages?
   **A:** Set `message` in the annotation or in a validation messages properties file.

### 1. Building Custom Validations inside Spring MVC

**Use Case:**
Imagine a user registration form where the user must provide a username and password. You want to ensure the username is unique and the password meets complexity rules (e.g., at least one uppercase, one digit, and special character).

**5 Bullet Points:**

* Spring MVC uses `@Valid` annotation along with JSR-303/JSR-380 (Bean Validation API) for validations.
* Custom validation is created by implementing `ConstraintValidator` and annotating fields with custom annotation.
* Validator logic can check database or complex business rules beyond simple regex or length checks.
* Integrates seamlessly with `BindingResult` to provide user feedback in UI.
* Can be applied on DTOs, entities, or directly on controller input parameters.

**Summary:**
Custom validations in Spring MVC extend standard annotation-based validations to include business-specific rules. By creating custom annotations and validator classes, you can enforce complex validation like uniqueness in DB or password strength. This enhances user input validation before processing or persisting data, leading to cleaner, more reliable code. Spring MVC’s integration ensures easy error handling and feedback in the UI layer.

**Code Example:**

```java
// Custom annotation
@Target({ ElementType.FIELD })
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Constraint(validatedBy = UniqueUsernameValidator.class)
public @interface UniqueUsername {
    String message() default "Username already exists";
    Class<?>[] groups() default {};
    Class<? extends Payload>[] payload() default {};
}

// Validator class
public class UniqueUsernameValidator implements ConstraintValidator<UniqueUsername, String> {

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;  // Assume JPA repo

    @Override
    public boolean isValid(String username, ConstraintValidatorContext context) {
        return username != null && !userRepository.existsByUsername(username);
    }
}

// DTO example
public class UserRegistrationDto {
    @UniqueUsername
    private String username;
    
    @Pattern(regexp = "^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[@#$%^&+=]).{8,}$", 
             message = "Password must contain uppercase, digit, and special char")
    private String password;
    
    // getters and setters
}

// Controller snippet
@PostMapping("/register")
public String registerUser(@Valid UserRegistrationDto dto, BindingResult result) {
    if (result.hasErrors()) {
        return "registrationForm";
    }
    // Save user logic
    return "redirect:/success";
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. **Q:** How do you create a custom validation in Spring MVC?
   **A:** Define a custom annotation and implement `ConstraintValidator`. Use the annotation on fields and integrate with Spring’s `@Valid`.

2. **Q:** How does Spring MVC handle validation errors?
   **A:** Validation errors are captured in `BindingResult` which can be checked to return error messages back to the view.

3. **Q:** Can you inject Spring beans inside a custom validator?
   **A:** Yes, if the validator is a Spring-managed bean, you can inject repositories or services using `@Autowired`.

### 2. Deep dive on OneToOne Relationship, Fetch Types, Cascade Types in ORM frameworks

**Use Case:**
A system manages users and their profile pictures. Each user has exactly one profile picture, and changes to a user should reflect on their picture entity.

**5 Bullet Points:**

* `@OneToOne` maps a one-to-one relationship between two entities.
* `FetchType.EAGER` fetches related entity immediately; `LAZY` defers until accessed.
* Cascading controls what operations (persist, remove, merge, detach) propagate from parent to child entity.
* Common cascade types: `ALL`, `PERSIST`, `MERGE`, `REMOVE`, `REFRESH`, `DETACH`.
* Proper fetch and cascade configurations avoid performance pitfalls and data integrity issues.

**Summary:**
`@OneToOne` relationships in ORM map exclusive associations between entities. Fetch types control when related data is loaded, impacting performance and memory usage. Cascade types dictate how lifecycle operations propagate, preventing orphaned records or stale data. Understanding and configuring these options correctly ensures efficient data handling and transactional consistency.

**Code Example:**

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;
    
    @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name = "profile_picture_id")
    private ProfilePicture profilePicture;
    
    // getters and setters
}

@Entity
public class ProfilePicture {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;
    
    private String url;
    
    // getters and setters
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. **Q:** What is the difference between FetchType.LAZY and FetchType.EAGER?
   **A:** LAZY delays loading related data until accessed, EAGER loads related data immediately with parent.

2. **Q:** What does CascadeType.ALL do in a one-to-one relationship?
   **A:** It propagates all entity lifecycle operations (persist, merge, remove, etc.) from parent to child.

3. **Q:** Why might you choose LAZY fetch for a OneToOne relation?
   **A:** To avoid loading heavy or rarely accessed related data unnecessarily, improving performance.

---

### 3. Spring Data JPA configurations for Person, Address, Roles tables and entities

**Use Case:**
An application stores persons with multiple addresses and roles (many-to-many between Person and Role).

**5 Bullet Points:**

* Define `@Entity` classes for Person, Address, and Role with proper JPA annotations.
* Use `@OneToMany` or `@ManyToOne` for Person-Address relationships.
* Use `@ManyToMany` with `@JoinTable` for Person-Roles relationship.
* Configure repositories extending `JpaRepository` for CRUD operations.
* Use Spring Boot auto-configuration for datasource, transaction management, and JPA vendor adapter.

**Summary:**
Spring Data JPA simplifies relational mapping and CRUD operations with annotations and repository interfaces. Defining entities with relationships like one-to-many and many-to-many allows complex domain models. Auto-configured repositories provide out-of-the-box DB access, while annotations define table structure and joins. This setup reduces boilerplate and accelerates development.

**Code Example:**

```java
@Entity
public class Person {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "person", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    private List<Address> addresses;

    @ManyToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinTable(name = "person_roles",
        joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "person_id"),
        inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "role_id"))
    private Set<Role> roles;

    // getters and setters
}

@Entity
public class Address {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String street;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "person_id")
    private Person person;

    // getters and setters
}

@Entity
public class Role {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String roleName;

    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "roles")
    private Set<Person> persons;

    // getters and setters
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. **Q:** How do you model a many-to-many relationship in JPA?
   **A:** Use `@ManyToMany` on both entities and define a `@JoinTable` to map the association table.

2. **Q:** What is the purpose of `mappedBy` in JPA?
   **A:** It indicates the owning side of the relationship, avoiding duplicate foreign keys and mapping conflicts.

3. **Q:** How does Spring Data JPA simplify data access?
   **A:** By providing repository interfaces like `JpaRepository` that implement common CRUD and pagination operations.

---

### 4. Introduction to One to One Relationship inside ORM frameworks

**Use Case:**
A banking app stores customer and their passport info, where each customer has exactly one passport.

**5 Bullet Points:**

* One-to-one means a single entity instance relates to exactly one instance of another entity.
* Implemented using `@OneToOne` annotation in ORM frameworks like Hibernate.
* Can be unidirectional or bidirectional.
* Typically represented by a foreign key constraint in the database.
* Often used for splitting entities to reduce complexity or for optional data.

**Summary:**
One-to-one relationships link two entities such that each instance in one table corresponds to exactly one instance in another. This can represent tightly coupled data logically separated into different tables. ORM annotations allow easy mapping, and the database ensures referential integrity with foreign keys. It's suitable for logically connected but distinct pieces of data.

**Code Example:**

```java
@Entity
public class Customer {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name = "passport_id")
    private Passport passport;

    // getters and setters
}

@Entity
public class Passport {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String passportNumber;

    // getters and setters
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. **Q:** What is a One-to-One relationship in ORM?
   **A:** It's an association where one entity instance corresponds to exactly one instance of another entity.

2. **Q:** How is a One-to-One relationship represented in a database?
   **A:** Usually with a foreign key constraint linking the primary key of one table to the other.

3. **Q:** What is the difference between unidirectional and bidirectional One-to-One?
   **A:** Unidirectional has reference from one entity only; bidirectional has references from both entities.

### 5. Making One to One Relationship configurations inside entity classes - Theory

**Use Case:**
Configuring entities for Employee and ParkingSpot, where each employee has one parking spot.

**5 Bullet Points:**

* Use `@OneToOne` annotation on the owning entity field.
* Use `@JoinColumn` to specify foreign key column on owning side.
* Use `mappedBy` attribute on inverse side for bidirectional relationships.
* Cascade types allow operations to propagate to the related entity.
* Fetch type determines when the related entity is loaded from DB.

**Summary:**
Configuring a One-to-One relationship requires marking one entity as owning side with `@JoinColumn`, and optionally the other side with `mappedBy`. Choosing cascade types and fetch strategies impacts performance and data integrity. Proper configuration ensures correct foreign key mapping and smooth ORM operations between tightly coupled entities.

**Code Example:**

```java
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(name = "parking_spot_id")
    private ParkingSpot parkingSpot;

    // getters and setters
}

@Entity
public class ParkingSpot {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String spotNumber;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "parkingSpot")
    private Employee employee;

    // getters and setters
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. **Q:** Which side owns the foreign key in a One-to-One relationship?
   **A:** The side with the `@JoinColumn` annotation is the owning side and holds the foreign key.

2. **Q:** What does `mappedBy` indicate?
   **A:** It indicates the non-owning (inverse) side of the relationship.

3. **Q:** Why configure fetch type in One-to-One relationships?
   **A:** To optimize performance by controlling when related data is fetched (immediately or lazily).

---

### 6. Deep dive on Fetch Types and Cascade Types in ORM frameworks

**Use Case:**
An e-commerce app loads orders and associated payment details. Fetching payment eagerly or lazily affects performance, and cascading saves or deletes simplifies operations.

**5 Bullet Points:**

* FetchType.LAZY loads related entities on-demand, reducing initial load time.
* FetchType.EAGER loads related entities immediately, useful for always-needed data.
* CascadeType.PERSIST propagates save operations to related entities.
* CascadeType.REMOVE deletes related entities when the parent is deleted.
* Properly chosen fetch and cascade types prevent N+1 query issues and data inconsistency.

**Summary:**
Fetch and cascade types govern entity loading and lifecycle propagation in ORM. LAZY fetch improves performance by delaying data loading; EAGER fetch simplifies code but may increase DB hits. Cascade types automate related entity persistence or deletion, reducing manual work. Misconfiguration can cause performance bottlenecks or unintended data loss.

**Code Example:**

```java
@Entity
public class Order {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name = "payment_id")
    private Payment payment;

    // getters and setters
}

@Entity
public class Payment {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String paymentMethod;

    // getters and setters
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. **Q:** What is the default fetch type for OneToOne and ManyToOne?
   **A:** The default is EAGER.

2. **Q:** What happens if CascadeType.REMOVE is used?
   **A:** Related child entities are deleted when the parent entity is removed.

3. **Q:** What are potential downsides of FetchType.EAGER?
   **A:** It can lead to performance issues by loading unnecessary data and causing N+1 query problems.

## 1. Making One‑to‑One Relationship Configurations Inside Entity Classes – Coding

**Use‑Case Example (users ↔ profiles):**
You have two entities, `User` and `UserProfile`, and each user must have exactly one profile.

### 🔹 5 Key Points

* Use `@OneToOne` on both sides (owner and mappedBy inverse side).
* Define `@JoinColumn` on the owning side to specify foreign key.
* The `mappedBy` attribute avoids duplicate join tables/columns.
* Choose `FetchType.LAZY` to defer profile load until requested.
* Use cascading to propagate save/remove operations between entities.

### 🔹 5‑Line Summary

A one‑to‑one mapping links two entities in a strict pair relationship. The owner side (typically `User`) defines `@JoinColumn` to create a foreign key. The inverse side (`UserProfile`) uses `mappedBy` to indicate the owner. Lazy loading avoids unnecessary SQL fetches until needed. Cascade options like `CascadeType.ALL` let operations like `persist`, `delete`, etc. propagate between linked entities.

```java
@Entity
public class User {
  @Id @GeneratedValue private Long id;
  private String username;

  @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
  @JoinColumn(name = "profile_id")
  private UserProfile profile;
  // getters & setters
}

@Entity
public class UserProfile {
  @Id @GeneratedValue private Long id;
  private String bio;

  @OneToOne(mappedBy = "profile", fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
  private User user;
  // getters & setters
}
```

### 🔹 Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** Why do we use `mappedBy`?
   **A:** `mappedBy` indicates the inverse side and prevents database schema duplication by telling JPA that the join column is mapped by the owner.
2. **Q:** What happens if you forget `cascade`?
   **A:** Without cascade, you'd need to save/update both entities separately, leading to errors if the child isn't persisted.
3. **Q:** When is eager fetch problematic?
   **A:** Eager fetch loads related entities every time, which can degrade performance if not always needed.

---

## 2. “OneToOne Relationship, Fetch Types, Cascade Types in ORM frameworks” Quiz

**Use‑Case:** Testing developers’ knowledge in object mapping.

### 🔹 5 Key Points

* `@OneToOne` creates a direct 1:1 link.
* **FetchType.EAGER** loads both sides together, **LAZY** loads on demand.
* `CascadeType.PERSIST` ensures child is saved with the parent.
* `CascadeType.REMOVE` deletes the child when the parent is deleted.
* `CascadeType.ALL` covers every cascade operation.

### 🔹 5‑Line Summary

A quiz on `@OneToOne`, fetch, and cascades checks understanding of data-loading and operations management. Fetch types dictate when related entities load; using the wrong one can cause performance issues or `LazyInitializationException`. Cascade types govern the propagation of persistence actions. Developers must match cascades with use cases, like ensuring a profile is created automatically with its user.

```java
@OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST)
@JoinColumn(name = "profile_id")
private UserProfile profile;
```

### 🔹 Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** What’s the difference between `CascadeType.MERGE` and `PERSIST`?
   **A:** `PERSIST` handles new entities, while `MERGE` updates detached ones.
2. **Q:** Why might `CascadeType.REMOVE` be risky?
   **A:** It can unintentionally delete important data if the cascade is misused.
3. **Q:** Can you mix fetch types?
   **A:** Yes, but mixing LAZY and EAGER based on use improves performance and avoids N+1 problems.

## 3. Spring Security Custom Authentication Using DB & Password Hashing

**Use‑Case:** Authentication against a users table with hashed passwords.

### 🔹 5 Key Points

* Implement `UserDetailsService` to load users from DB.
* Store passwords hashed using `BCryptPasswordEncoder`.
* Configure `DaoAuthenticationProvider` to leverage your service and encoder.
* Define `SecurityFilterChain` to set up authentication in `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`‑style.
* Always avoid clear‑text passwords; use `matches()` for authentication.

### 🔹 5‑Line Summary

Spring Security can be configured to authenticate using a custom DB table by implementing `UserDetailsService`. You should hash passwords with a secure encoder like BCrypt. Use a `DaoAuthenticationProvider` wired with your service and encoder. Passwords are never stored or verified in plain text. This setup supports secure login flows and RBAC.

```java
@Service
public class MyUserDetailsService implements UserDetailsService {
  @Autowired UserRepository repo;
  @Override
  public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String u) {
    return repo.findByUsername(u)
      .map(uEntity -> User.withUsername(uEntity.getUsername())
                          .password(uEntity.getPassword())
                          .roles("USER").build())
      .orElseThrow(() -> new UsernameNotFoundException(u));
  }
}

@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig {
  @Bean public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() { return new BCryptPasswordEncoder(); }
  @Bean public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.authorizeHttpRequests(req -> req.anyRequest().authenticated())
        .formLogin();
    return http.build();
  }
  @Bean public AuthenticationProvider authProvider(UserDetailsService uds, PasswordEncoder pe) {
    var provider = new DaoAuthenticationProvider();
    provider.setUserDetailsService(uds);
    provider.setPasswordEncoder(pe);
    return provider;
  }
}
```

### 🔹 Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** Why use BCrypt over MD5/SHA?
   **A:** BCrypt is intentionally slow and salted, offering strong protection against brute‑force and rainbow attacks.
2. **Q:** What is `UserDetailsService` used for?
   **A:** It loads user data (username, hashed password, authorities) required for authentication.
3. **Q:** How do you handle account lockout after failed attempts?
   **A:** Implement event listeners on `AuthenticationFailureBadCredentialsEvent` and update a failed\_attempts field in DB.

## 4. Understanding Spring Security Configurations for Custom Authentication Logic

**Use‑Case:** You need to customize authentication flow (e.g., via API key, MFA, or OTP) beyond standard username/password.

### 🔹 5 Key Points

* Override `configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)` or set a custom `AuthenticationProvider`.
* Register your own `AuthenticationFilter` (e.g., `OncePerRequestFilter`) in the filter chain.
* Use `AuthenticationSuccessHandler` and `FailureHandler` to customize responses.
* Define custom `AuthenticationToken` and `AuthenticationManager` for non-standard flows.
* Ensure secure exception handling and endpoint protection via `HttpSecurity`.

### 🔹 5‑Line Summary

Custom authentication requires replacing or extending the default provider. You might add a bespoke filter (for API key or OTP) before the `UsernamePasswordAuthFilter`. Tokens are wrapped in your custom `AuthenticationToken`. Proper handlers direct post-auth behavior. The result is a secure, flexible auth flow aligned to your validation rules.

```java
public class ApiKeyAuthFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {
  @Override protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res, FilterChain chain)
      throws ServletException, IOException {
    String apiKey = req.getHeader("X-API-KEY");
    if (apiKey != null) {
      Authentication auth = new ApiKeyAuthenticationToken(apiKey);
      auth = authenticationManager().authenticate(auth);
      SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(auth);
    }
    chain.doFilter(req, res);
  }
}
```

### 🔹 Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** Where do you add a custom filter in Spring Security?
   **A:** Register it in `HttpSecurity`, e.g., `http.addFilterBefore(new MyFilter(), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class)`.
2. **Q:** What’s the role of `AuthenticationProvider`?
   **A:** It validates authentication requests and returns fully authenticated tokens.
3. **Q:** How do you handle authentication failures in filters?
   **A:** Implement `AuthenticationFailureHandler` and call it when exceptions occur.

---

## 5. Implement Spring Security Changes for Custom Authentication Logic

**Use‑Case:** Integrating a new REST endpoint with OTP to enhance login security.

### 🔹 5 Key Points

* Register your custom `AuthenticationProvider` through a Bean.
* Add authentication filters for OTP or API key.
* Ensure `SecurityFilterChain` includes public OTP endpoints and secures others.
* Use custom handlers to manage responses (e.g. JSON success/failure).
* Always disable CSRF for stateless APIs, and configure CORS if needed.

### 🔹 5‑Line Summary

Implementing custom logic means configuring an `AuthenticationProvider` and custom filter with the same manager. You secure OTP endpoints while protecting others. Handlers format API responses. Ensure CSRF is disabled or configured appropriately for stateless APIs. This makes authentication robust and extensible.

```java
@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
  http
    .csrf(csrf -> csrf.disable())
    .addFilterBefore(new OtpAuthFilter(), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class)
    .authenticationProvider(otpAuthProvider())
    .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
        .requestMatchers("/login", "/otp").permitAll()
        .anyRequest().authenticated()
    );
  return http.build();
}
```

### 🔹 Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** How do you wire a custom `AuthenticationProvider`?
   **A:** Declare it as a `@Bean` and add `http.authenticationProvider(yourProvider)`.
2. **Q:** Why disable CSRF in REST services?
   **A:** Stateless REST APIs typically don't use cookies, making CSRF protection unnecessary.
3. **Q:** How do handlers differ from filters?
   **A:** Filters intercept requests; handlers manage the HTTP response after auth events.

---

## 6. Problems with Authentication Logic Using Plain Text Passwords

**Use‑Case:** Legacy application stores passwords directly in DB; you observe high security risk.

### 🔹 5 Key Points

* Exposes credentials if the database leaks.
* Remains vulnerable to network sniffing if TLS isn't enforced.
* Doesn’t comply with security standards (HIPAA, PCI).
* Enables replay attacks—captured credentials can be reused.
* Prevents integration of salting/hashing, leading to weak defense.

### 🔹 5‑Line Summary

Plain-text passwords are a critical failure—any data breach directly reveals credentials. They violate compliance and open doors to intercept and replay attacks. Modern security standards mandate hashing with salt. To improve, migrate to secure hashing and enforce TLS. This sensor shift is fundamental for application integrity.

```properties
# Do not store in plain text!
# switch to hashed: e.g. bcrypt:
{
  username: "alice",
  password: "$2a$10$7QCyas..."
}
```

### 🔹 Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** What are the risks of plain text passwords?
   **A:** Exposed credentials on DB leaks, replay attacks, and compliance violations.
2. **Q:** What immediate measures should be taken?
   **A:** Hash all stored passwords with a secure algorithm like BCrypt ASAP.
3. **Q:** How do you transition from plain text to hashed passwords?
   **A:** Hash on next login or force a password reset, hashing the old password and updating the DB.

## 7. Deep Dive on Encoding, Encryption and Hashing for Password Management

**Use-Case:** Secure password storage and comparison in modern web applications.

### 🔹 5 Key Points

* **Encoding** is reversible (e.g., Base64), used for data transport—not for security.
* **Encryption** is two-way and requires a secret key for decryption.
* **Hashing** is one-way and irreversible, ideal for password storage.
* Good password hashes (like BCrypt, Argon2) use **salting** and **key stretching**.
* Never use general-purpose hash algorithms (like MD5 or SHA-1) for passwords.

### 🔹 5-Line Summary

Encoding is for readability (not security), encryption protects data in transit or storage, and hashing secures passwords irreversibly. For passwords, hashing with salt (e.g., using `BCrypt`) ensures even repeated passwords are stored differently. Hashing is non-reversible, meaning original values can't be recovered—perfect for authentication checks. Encryption is useful for sensitive but retrievable data, unlike passwords.

```java
String password = "mySecret123";
String encoded = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(password.getBytes()); // Encoding

Key key = new SecretKeySpec("MySecretKey12345".getBytes(), "AES"); // Encryption
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
byte[] encrypted = cipher.doFinal(password.getBytes());

// Hashing (for passwords)
BCryptPasswordEncoder encoder = new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
String hashedPassword = encoder.encode(password);
```

### 🔹 Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** What’s the main difference between encryption and hashing?
   **A:** Encryption is reversible with a key, hashing is one-way and irreversible.
2. **Q:** Why not use SHA-256 for passwords?
   **A:** It’s too fast, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks—use slow hashes like BCrypt.
3. **Q:** How does salting improve security?
   **A:** It ensures two identical passwords result in different hashes, preventing rainbow table attacks.

## 8. Deep Dive on `PasswordEncoder` & `BCryptPasswordEncoder`

**Use-Case:** Securing user passwords during signup and login.

### 🔹 5 Key Points

* `PasswordEncoder` is an interface used by Spring Security for hashing logic.
* `BCryptPasswordEncoder` is its secure default implementation.
* `encode()` hashes the password; `matches()` verifies it.
* Hashed strings include a salt and cost factor internally.
* Passwords must never be stored or compared in plain text.

### 🔹 5-Line Summary

Spring's `PasswordEncoder` helps abstract password hashing logic. `BCryptPasswordEncoder` implements secure, salted hashing for password management. Its output embeds both the salt and the computational cost (work factor). During login, `matches(raw, encoded)` verifies authenticity. Using this encoder is a security best practice for all web applications.

```java
@Bean
public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
    return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
}

// Usage
String rawPassword = "myPassword";
String hashed = passwordEncoder.encode(rawPassword);

boolean isMatch = passwordEncoder.matches(rawPassword, hashed); // true
```

### 🔹 Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** What does the BCrypt output string contain?
   **A:** It contains the version, cost factor, salt, and hashed password.
2. **Q:** Why does BCrypt use a work factor?
   **A:** It slows down hashing to make brute-force attacks infeasible.
3. **Q:** What happens if you re-encode the same password twice?
   **A:** You'll get different hashes due to unique salting.

---

## 9. Implementing Password Hashing with `BCryptPasswordEncoder`

**Use-Case:** Users sign up with passwords stored securely in the database.

### 🔹 5 Key Points

* Call `encode()` before saving the password to the DB.
* Hash passwords in service layer, not controller.
* Never manually compare passwords—use `matches()`.
* Always inject `PasswordEncoder` as a Spring Bean.
* Even admin accounts must use the same hashing logic.

### 🔹 5-Line Summary

When registering a user, hash the password using `BCryptPasswordEncoder.encode()` before saving to the database. During login, Spring Security (via `UserDetailsService`) uses `matches()` to validate. This approach ensures your app never handles or stores raw passwords. Keep this logic centralized in the service layer for maintainability and security.

```java
@Service
public class UserService {
    @Autowired private UserRepository repo;
    @Autowired private PasswordEncoder encoder;

    public void registerUser(User user) {
        user.setPassword(encoder.encode(user.getPassword()));
        repo.save(user);
    }

    public boolean login(String username, String rawPassword) {
        User user = repo.findByUsername(username).orElseThrow();
        return encoder.matches(rawPassword, user.getPassword());
    }
}
```

### 🔹 Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** Where should you hash the password in a Spring app?
   **A:** In the service layer before persisting to the DB.
2. **Q:** Why is `matches()` preferred over direct comparison?
   **A:** It handles hash verification including salt and cost checks.
3. **Q:** Can BCrypt hashes be reversed?
   **A:** No—BCrypt is a one-way function.

## 10. Quick Tip - To Disable the javax Validations in Spring Data JPA

**Use-Case:** Temporarily bypass validation annotations (like `@NotNull`) for testing or specific flows.

### 🔹 5 Key Points

* Spring Boot auto-validates entity fields during persistence.
* Annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Size` are enforced unless disabled.
* You can disable validations at the method level using `@Validated(false)` (manual override).
* Alternatively, avoid calling `validate()` programmatically or remove the annotations temporarily.
* Best for test cases, partial saves, or legacy migration.

### 🔹 5-Line Summary

Spring Data JPA honors javax validation annotations by default. If needed (e.g., during batch imports or tests), you can bypass them by removing annotations or customizing the validation layer. Avoid using this in production logic—it’s a temporary escape hatch. Proper validation ensures data integrity but can be selectively ignored.

```java
// In your entity
// @NotNull // <- Commented out or removed temporarily
private String name;

// Or disable validator globally (not recommended for prod)
spring.jpa.properties.javax.persistence.validation.mode=none
```

### 🔹 Interview Q\&A

1. **Q:** Why might you disable javax validation?
   **A:** For test data loading, partial data migration, or legacy compatibility.
2. **Q:** Is it safe to disable validation globally?
   **A:** No—it compromises data integrity; should only be temporary.
3. **Q:** What’s an alternative to disabling validation?
   **A:** Use conditional validation groups or DTOs with relaxed rules.

### 1. Spring Security Custom Authentication Using DB & Password Hashing

**Real-time Use Case:**
When building a web application that requires secure user login, you store user credentials in a database with hashed passwords. You implement custom authentication to verify users against this data during login.

**5 Bullet Points Explanation:**

* **Custom Authentication Provider:** Extend `AuthenticationProvider` to create your own authentication logic connecting to DB.
* **Password Hashing:** Use `BCryptPasswordEncoder` to securely hash and verify passwords.
* **UserDetailsService:** Implement to load user data (username, roles, hashed password) from DB.
* **Security Configuration:** Register the custom authentication provider in Spring Security config.
* **Session Management & Error Handling:** Customize failure handlers and session fixation protection for better security.

**Summary:**
Spring Security allows you to plug in custom authentication logic to verify users against your database instead of in-memory or LDAP. Password hashing, typically via BCrypt, ensures stored passwords are secure. This setup improves security and flexibility by integrating with existing user repositories. The UserDetailsService interface plays a key role in loading user credentials from DB. Proper configuration of Spring Security ensures secure authentication workflows with robust session and error handling.

**Code Example:**

```java
// User Entity (simplified)
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    private String username;
    private String password; // stored as BCrypt hash
    private String role;
    // getters and setters
}

// UserDetailsService Implementation
@Service
public class CustomUserDetailsService implements UserDetailsService {
    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @Override
    public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String username) throws UsernameNotFoundException {
        User user = userRepository.findByUsername(username)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new UsernameNotFoundException("User not found"));
        return new org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User(
            user.getUsername(),
            user.getPassword(),
            Collections.singleton(new SimpleGrantedAuthority(user.getRole()))
        );
    }
}

// Security Configuration
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Autowired
    private CustomUserDetailsService userDetailsService;

    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth.userDetailsService(userDetailsService)
            .passwordEncoder(passwordEncoder());
    }
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. **Q:** Why use BCryptPasswordEncoder for password hashing?
   **A:** BCrypt includes a salt internally and is adaptive, meaning it can increase hashing complexity over time to stay secure against brute force attacks.

2. **Q:** What is the role of UserDetailsService in Spring Security?
   **A:** It loads user-specific data during authentication, fetching username, password, and authorities from the database or other sources.

3. **Q:** How does Spring Security verify a user’s password?
   **A:** It compares the hashed password stored in DB with the hashed form of the password entered during login using a PasswordEncoder like BCryptPasswordEncoder.

### 2. Deep Dive on OneToMany, ManyToOne Relationships in ORM Frameworks

**Real-time Use Case:**
A blog application where one Author can write many Posts, but each Post is written by only one Author.

**5 Bullet Points Explanation:**

* **OneToMany:** Represents one parent entity related to multiple child entities.
* **ManyToOne:** Represents child entity referencing a single parent entity.
* **Foreign Key Management:** The child table usually contains the foreign key pointing to the parent.
* **Lazy vs Eager Loading:** Controls when related entities are fetched (on demand or immediately).
* **Cascade Types:** Define how operations (persist, delete) propagate from parent to children.

**Summary:**
OneToMany and ManyToOne relationships model hierarchical data where one entity owns or relates to multiple others, typical in relational databases. The parent entity has a collection of children, while each child holds a reference to its parent. ORM frameworks map these relations using foreign keys, with configurations to control loading behavior and cascading operations. Understanding these relationships is key to designing efficient, normalized database schemas and leveraging ORM capabilities effectively.

**Code Example:**

```java
@Entity
public class Author {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "author", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    private List<Post> posts = new ArrayList<>();
    // getters and setters
}

@Entity
public class Post {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String title;

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(name = "author_id")
    private Author author;
    // getters and setters
}
```

**Interview Questions:**

1. **Q:** Which side is the owning side in a OneToMany/ManyToOne relationship?
   **A:** The ManyToOne side is the owning side since it contains the foreign key.

2. **Q:** What is the default fetch type for OneToMany and ManyToOne?
   **A:** OneToMany is LAZY by default; ManyToOne is EAGER by default.

3. **Q:** What is the use of `mappedBy` in OneToMany?
   **A:** It indicates the field in the child entity that owns the relationship, preventing duplicate foreign keys.

---

### 3. Introduction to OneToMany & ManyToOne Mappings

**Real-time Use Case:**
A customer placing multiple orders; each order is linked to one customer.

**5 Bullet Points Explanation:**

* **OneToMany:** Parent entity with a list or set of children.
* **ManyToOne:** Child entity referencing the parent via foreign key.
* **Bidirectional vs Unidirectional:** Mappings can go both ways or only one.
* **Cascade Options:** Determines if operations on parent affect children.
* **Lazy Loading:** Improves performance by delaying data fetch until needed.

**Summary:**
OneToMany and ManyToOne mappings allow ORM frameworks to represent relational database relationships naturally in Java entities. One entity owns multiple related entities, while each child entity points back to its parent. These mappings can be unidirectional or bidirectional, with cascading and fetch type configurations for control over persistence and performance. They are foundational concepts for designing data models in ORM.

**Code Example:**

(Same as previous example, but can be kept simpler or even unidirectional.)

## 1. Implement ManyToMany configurations inside Entity classes

**Use case:** A blog system where `Post` has many `Tag`s and `Tag` can belong to many `Post`s.

**🧠 Explanations:**

* Use `@ManyToMany` on both sides with `mappedBy` to avoid duplicate join tables.
* Define a `@JoinTable` only on the owner side specifying `joinColumns` & `inverseJoinColumns`.
* Use `Set<>` or `List<>`, but `Set<>` avoids duplicates.
* Eager vs lazy fetching: default is lazy—use carefully to avoid N+1.
* Cascade operations allow automatic persistence of related entities (e.g. `CascadeType.PERSIST`).

**📋 Summary:**
In a blog context, posts and tags form a ManyToMany relation. You annotate both entities with `@ManyToMany`, designate one as owner with `@JoinTable` to define join columns, and use `mappedBy` on the inverse side. Lazy fetching is default, and cascading ensures consistency. Sets help avoid duplicates. This allows saving or querying posts with tags cleanly and relationally.

```java
@Entity
class Post {
  @Id @GeneratedValue Long id;
  String title;
  @ManyToMany(cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST)
  @JoinTable(name="post_tag",
    joinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="post_id"),
    inverseJoinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="tag_id"))
  Set<Tag> tags = new HashSet<>();
}

@Entity
class Tag {
  @Id @GeneratedValue Long id;
  String name;
  @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "tags")
  Set<Post> posts = new HashSet<>();
}
```

**✔ Interview Q\&As:**

1. **Q:** Why use `mappedBy`?
   **A:** To tell Hibernate which entity owns the join table, preventing duplicate tables.
2. **Q:** What fetch type is default on `ManyToMany`?
   **A:** Lazy.
3. **Q:** What is a `JoinTable` and why use it?
   **A:** It defines the underlying table mapping two foreign keys and controls its naming.

---

## 2. "ManyToMany Relationship & Configurations inside ORM frameworks" Quiz

**Use case:** Online marketplace: `Product` and `Category` many-to-many.

**🧠 Explanations:**

* Choose owner entity (decides join table mapping).
* `@JoinTable` name and join column names for clarity.
* Use `@JsonIgnore` or DTOs to avoid infinite serialization loops.
* Apply cascading selectively—don’t cascade delete unless intended.
* Bidirectional access through helper methods (`addCategory`, `removeCategory`).

**📋 Summary:**
Mapping many-to-many in ORMs (like Hibernate) involves annotating both entity sides, defining a join table on the owner side, managing fetch strategy, handling JSON serialization, and controlling cascades. It requires bidirectional data integrity via helper methods.

```java
public void addCategory(Category c) {
  categories.add(c);
  c.getProducts().add(this);
}
public void removeCategory(Category c) { /* mirror logic */ }
```

**✔ Interview Q\&As:**

1. **Q:** What's a helper method for in ManyToMany?
   **A:** Keeps both sides in sync.
2. **Q:** Why avoid cascading `REMOVE`?
   **A:** Risk of unintended deletions across entities.
3. **Q:** How to prevent infinite loops in JSON?
   **A:** Use `@JsonIgnore` or `@JsonManagedReference/@JsonBackReference`.

---

## 3. Sorting & Pagination inside Spring Data JPA

**Use case:** Customer admin console listing with filtering, sorting, paging.

**🧠 Explanations:**

* Repos extend `PagingAndSortingRepository`.
* Accept `Pageable` or `Sort` in repository methods.
* Controller parses params: `page`, `size`, `sort`.
* Service returns `Page<T>` with metadata for UI.
* Spring Data handles underlying SQL `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT/OFFSET`.

**📋 Summary:**
Spring Data simplifies sorting and paging via repository interfaces. You pass `Pageable` or `Sort`, and it returns a `Page<T>` containing both content and metadata. Controllers can accept query parameters for page number, size, and sort field/order, and repositories automatically apply SQL-level optimizations.

```java
Page<Customer> findAll(Pageable p);
...
Page<Customer> page = repo.findAll(PageRequest.of(page, size, Sort.by("name").ascending()));
```

**✔ Interview Q\&As:**

1. **Q:** Difference between `Page` and `Slice`?
   **A:** `Page` contains total count; `Slice` doesn’t.
2. **Q:** How to sort multiple fields?
   **A:** `Sort.by("a", "b.desc")` or chain `.and(...)`.
3. **Q:** Does pagination work with streaming?
   **A:** Use `Streamable` or custom queries; default page uses lists.

---

## 4. Introduction to Sorting inside Spring Data JPA

**Use case:** Admin list view sorted by created date or status.

**🧠 Explanations:**

* Sorting via `Sort` object in repo methods.
* `Sort.by("field").ascending()/descending()`.
* Combine multiple sorts with `sort.and(...)`.
* Can pass sort to `findAll(Sort)`.
* Works with both derived queries and JPQL queries.

**📋 Summary:**
Sorting in Spring Data JPA uses the `Sort` object. You specify directions and fields, combining multiple criteria as needed. Simply pass it into methods like `findAll(Sort)` or custom query methods, and the framework constructs `ORDER BY` SQL. It’s flexible, composable, and integrates cleanly with paging if needed.

```java
List<Customer> sorted = repo.findAll(Sort.by("lastName").descending().and(Sort.by("id")));
```

**✔ Interview Q\&As:**

1. **Q:** Can you sort on nonexistent fields?
   **A:** No – leads to errors at runtime or startup.
2. **Q:** How do you sort on nested properties?
   **A:** Use `Sort.by("address.city")`, if properly JPA-mapped.
3. **Q:** Default sort if none provided?
   **A:** No guarantees — unspecified order.

---

## 5. Implement & Demo of Static Sorting

**Use case:** Predefined sort on homepage post list.

**🧠 Explanations:**

* Hard-code `Sort` in service method.
* Doesn’t depend on client input.
* Simple fixed ordering (e.g., by date descending).
* Great for admin-default views or dashboards.
* Less flexibility but easiest to implement.

**📋 Summary:**
Static sorting defines a fixed ordering logic in code, independent of user input. It's simple and appropriate for standard views. You build a `Sort` object once and pass it into repository methods. It provides maintainable, consistent ordering without extra complexity.

```java
List<Post> recent = repo.findAll(Sort.by("createdAt").descending());
```

**✔ Interview Q\&As:**

1. **Q:** What is static sorting?
   **A:** Predefined ordering built in service logic.
2. **Q:** When is it useful?
   **A:** In static UI views or dashboards.
3. **Q:** Disadvantage of static sort?
   **A:** No client control or flexibility.

---

## 6. Implement & Demo of Dynamic Sorting

**Use case:** Admin filter screen with user-chosen sort field.

**🧠 Explanations:**

* Accept sort field + direction via client (e.g., query params).
* Construct `Sort` dynamically using `Sort.by(field)` and direction.
* Validate user-provided fields to avoid injection.
* Combine with pagination for full control.
* Call `repo.findAll(PageRequest.of(page, size, sort))`.

**📋 Summary:**
Dynamic sorting gives end-users control over ordering. You map request parameters to build a `Sort` object, validate inputs, and pass it into repository or service methods. This is paired often with pagination to create full-featured list endpoints.

```java
Sort sort = Sort.by(direction.equals("asc") ? Sort.Direction.ASC : Sort.Direction.DESC, field);
Page<Customer> p = repo.findAll(PageRequest.of(page, size, sort));
```

**✔ Interview Q\&As:**

1. **Q:** How protect fields in dynamic sort?
   **A:** Maintain a whitelist of allowed fields.
2. **Q:** How to default fallback sort?
   **A:** Use a default `Sort` if params are invalid or missing.
3. **Q:** Sorting performance concerns?
   **A:** Proper indexing on sorted columns matters.

---

## 7. Introduction to Pagination inside Spring Data JPA

**Use case:** Large user list split into pages to improve UI performance.

**🧠 Explanations:**

* Use `Pageable` interface to specify page number + size (+ optional sort).
* Repos return `Page<T>` which includes totals and metadata.
* Controllers can expose endpoints like `?page=2&size=50`.
* Handle out-of-bounds errors or provide defaults.
* Works seamlessly with `findAll` or custom queries.

**📋 Summary:**
Spring Data's paging lets you handle large datasets by slicing them. The controller delegates to repository using `Pageable`, and receives a `Page<T>` containing content and info like total pages. This promotes fast, memory-safe queries and user-friendly pagination API.

```java
Page<Customer> p = repo.findAll(PageRequest.of(page, size));
```

**✔ Interview Q\&As:**

1. **Q:** What info does `Page<T>` include?
   **A:** Content, total pages, total elements, current page, etc.
2. **Q:** Zero-based or one-based pages?
   **A:** Zero-based (`page = 0` is first).
3. **Q:** How to disable counting total?
   **A:** Use `Slice<T>` to avoid expensive count queries.

---

## 8. Implement & Demo of Pagination & Dynamic Sorting

**Use case:** Product catalog with page-by-page browsing and user-chosen sort.

**🧠 Explanations:**

* Controller reads `page`, `size`, `sortField`, `sortDir`.
* Validate `sortField` against allowed list.
* Build `PageRequest.of(page, size, sort)`.
* Delegate to repo: `findAll(Pageable)`.
* Response returns JSON with content plus paging metadata.

**📋 Summary:**
This combines pagination and dynamic sorting for full-featured list APIs. Clients pass in page index, size, and desired sorting. The service validates and constructs a `PageRequest`, queries the database efficiently, and returns both content and pagination info to the client.

```java
PageRequest pr = PageRequest.of(page, size, Sort.by(dir, field));
Page<Product> result = repo.findAll(pr);
```

**✔ Interview Q\&As:**

1. **Q:** How to prevent expensive count query?
   **A:** Use `Slice<T>` instead of `Page<T>`.
2. **Q:** How to include next/prev links?
   **A:** Build them in controller using `Page.hasNext()`, etc.
3. **Q:** Why validate `sortField`?
   **A:** To prevent SQL injection or invalid columns.

Below is a structured breakdown covering each requested topic. For each, I've included:

* ✅ **5 real-time use-case bullet points**
* 📝 **5-line concise summary**
* 💻 **Code sample**
* 🎯 **3 interview Q\&A**

---

## 1. Writing Custom Queries inside Spring Data JPA

**Use‑cases:**

* Retrieve orders placed in the last hour for a live dashboard.
* Filter products matching a user-entered regex pattern.
* Load only active users with non-null last login via partial loading.
* Join `Order` and `Customer` for a combined view without extra entities.
* Aggregate monthly sales grouped by region into DTOs.

**Summary:**
Custom queries let you define precise retrieval logic beyond CRUD, using JPQL or native SQL. They enable complex joins, filters, grouping, paging or DTO projection. Useful when method names become unreadably long. Supports pagination and dynamic parameters. They live on Repository interfaces via annotations or XML.

```java
public interface OrderRepo extends JpaRepository<Order, Long> {
  @Query("SELECT new com.app.dto.SalesDTO(o.customer.region, sum(o.total)) " +
         "FROM Order o WHERE o.createdAt > :since GROUP BY o.customer.region")
  List<SalesDTO> findSalesSince(@Param("since") LocalDateTime since);
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** Why use custom queries over method names?
   **A:** For readability, flexibility, performance (JOINs, aggregation), and DTO projections where method names won't suffice.
2. **Q:** How to support paging in custom queries?
   **A:** Return `Page<T>` and accept `Pageable` param; Spring Data builds count query automatically.
3. **Q:** Can I use native SQL in custom queries?
   **A:** Yes, via `@Query(..., nativeQuery = true)`.

---

## 2. Introduction to custom queries using `@Query`, `@NamedQuery`, `@NamedNativeQuery` & JPQL

**Use‑cases:**

* Use `@Query` for lightweight inlined logic directly in interface.
* `@NamedQuery` centralizes reusable JPQL in entity definitions.
* `@NamedNativeQuery` allows vendor-specific SQL/performance tuning.
* JPQL supports entity graph traversals and DTO mapping.
* Use named queries across multiple repos/entities with common signatures.

**Summary:**
Spring Data JPA custom queries support both JPQL (entity‑centric) and native SQL. `@Query` is inline & flexible. `@NamedQuery` and `@NamedNativeQuery` reside on entity definitions, promoting reuse and design separation. They support both string and type-safe return types. Using JPQL maintains portability, while native queries give you fine‑grained SQL control.

```java
@Entity
@NamedQuery(name = "User.byEmail",
    query = "SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.email = :email")
@NamedNativeQuery(name = "User.byStatusNative",
    query = "SELECT * FROM users u WHERE u.status = :status",
    resultClass = User.class)
public class User { ... }
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** Native vs JPQL differences?
   **A:** JPQL uses entities, portable; native SQL uses actual tables/columns, may use DB-specific functions.
2. **Q:** Why use named queries?
   **A:** For reuse, type-safety, separation from repo, easier maintenance, pre-compilation in some providers.
3. **Q:** How to call a named query from the repo?
   **A:** Define in entity, then use `@Query(name = "User.byEmail") List<User> findByEmail(@Param("email") String email);`

---

## 3. Writing Custom Queries using `@Query` Annotation

**Use‑cases:**

* Inline querying recent customer activity limit 10.
* Join `Product` and `Category` filtering by category name dynamically.
* Fetch DTO projection to `LightUser` to reduce data load.
* Use JSON functions in native SQL for PostgreSQL attributes.
* Count records with specific conditions.

**Summary:**
`@Query` enables inline JPQL/native SQL directly on repository methods. It supports dynamic parameter binding (`:param` / `?1`), returns entities, DTOs, projections, paginated types. Native SQL supported via `nativeQuery = true`. Ideal for quick custom fetches without external definition overhead.

```java
public interface ProductRepo extends JpaRepository<Product,Long> {
  @Query("SELECT new com.app.dto.LightProduct(p.id, p.name) " +
         "FROM Product p JOIN p.category c WHERE c.name = :cat")
  Page<LightProduct> findLightByCategory(@Param("cat") String category, Pageable pg);
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** JPQL vs native SQL in `@Query`?
   **A:** JPQL is entity-based and portable; native SQL lets you use database-specific features and raw tables.
2. **Q:** How do you project to DTOs?
   **A:** Use constructor expressions: `new com.app.dto.X(e.field1, e.field2)` in JPQL.
3. **Q:** How to use pagination?
   **A:** Return `Page<T>` and accept `Pageable`, Spring Data handles count query.

---

## 4. Writing Custom Update Queries using `@Query`, `@Modifying`, `@Transactional` Annotations

**Use‑cases:**

* Bulk status update of orders older than 30 days.
* Reset failed login counts after timed lockout.
* Apply percentage discount to all premium products.
* Mark notifications as read in batch via query.
* Move archived documents by setting new folder attribute.

**Summary:**
Bulk updates/deletes bypass persistence context, but need `@Modifying` & a transaction. Use JPQL/native queries with `@Query`, annotate repository method with `@Modifying`, and it must run within a transactional context (`@Transactional`, or managed service). Return modified row count (`int`).

```java
public interface OrderRepo extends JpaRepository<Order,Long> {
  @Modifying
  @Transactional
  @Query("UPDATE Order o SET o.status = 'ARCHIVED' WHERE o.createdAt < :cutoff")
  int archiveOldOrders(@Param("cutoff") LocalDate cutoff);
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** Why is `@Modifying` needed?
   **A:** Marks the query as one changing data (not select); Spring uses `executeUpdate()` instead of `getResultList()`.
2. **Q:** Why `@Transactional`?
   **A:** Updates require a transaction to commit; else changes won’t persist.
3. **Q:** How to clear persistence context after modifying?
   **A:** Add `clearAutomatically = true` on `@Modifying`, or call `EntityManager.clear()` manually.

---

## 5. Deep dive on `@NamedQuery`, `@NamedNativeQuery` inside Spring Data JPA

**Use‑cases:**

* Centralized complex join logic reused across services.
* Use native query to leverage DB-specific window functions.
* Switch implementations by replacing `@NamedQuery` rather than repo code.
* Share common queries between microservices/entities.
* Pre-compiled named queries give potential performance benefit in some JPA providers.

**Summary:**
`@NamedQuery` and `@NamedNativeQuery` are defined at the entity level, and referenced by name in repos. Named JPQL queries enhance portability and reuse. Named Native queries allow complex SQL, results mapped to entities or DTOs. Good for decoupling SQL from interface code and enabling provider-level pre-compilation.

```java
@Entity
@NamedQuery(name = "Order.findHighValue",
    query = "SELECT o FROM Order o WHERE o.total > :minTotal")
@NamedNativeQuery(name = "Order.findByRegionNative",
    query = "SELECT * FROM orders o JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id=c.id WHERE c.region = :reg",
    resultClass = Order.class)
public class Order { ... }
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** Benefits of named queries?
   **A:** Reusability, maintainability, compile-time checking, can be loaded once at startup.
2. **Q:** How to define return type for named native query?
   **A:** Use `resultClass` for mapping to entity or `SqlResultSetMapping` for custom DTOs.
3. **Q:** Differences between `@NamedQuery` and `@NamedNativeQuery`?
   **A:** One is JPQL (portable, entity-based), the other is raw SQL (DB-specific, flexible but less portable).

---

## 6. Writing Custom Queries using `@NamedQuery`, `@NamedNativeQuery` Annotations

**Use‑cases:**

* Standard filter by status and creation date reused globally.
* Native query using full-text search index support.
* Named queries across repos reducing duplicated code.
* Map complex result sets into lightweight DTOs.
* Provide vendor-specific SQL for advanced grouping or analytics.

**Summary:**
Using named queries means you define them once in entities with a unique name. Repos use `@Query(name="...")` to invoke them. Named native queries support full SQL features including functions, indexes. Good for decoupling query logic from code and centralizing it at entity level.

```java
@Repository
public interface OrderRepo extends JpaRepository<Order, Long> {
  @Query(name = "Order.findHighValue")
  List<Order> fetchHighValue(@Param("minTotal") BigDecimal minTotal);

  @Query(name = "Order.findByRegionNative")
  List<Order> findByRegion(@Param("reg") String region);
}
```

**Interview Q\&A:**

1. **Q:** How to call named native queries with custom result mapping?
   **A:** Use `@SqlResultSetMapping` in the entity for DTO mapping.
2. **Q:** What's the scope of named queries?
   **A:** Scoped by persistence unit; globally available wherever entity manager can see them.
3. **Q:** Are named queries precompiled?
   **A:** Some JPA providers parse and validate them at startup, helping catch errors early.

---

Below is a structured guide for each topic with a real-time coding example, bullet‑point explanations, a 5‑line summary, code snippet, and three interview questions & answers.

---

## 1. **Building REST Services using Spring framework**

* **Use case:** Setting up a Spring Boot project exposing APIs for CRUD operations.
* Spring initializes with embedded Tomcat, dependency injection, configurable via `application.properties`.
* Define domain model, `<Entity>Repository` (extends `JpaRepository`) for data access ([reddit.com][1], [reddit.com][2]).
* Create service layer for business logic, optional transactional boundaries.
* Controller layer annotated with `@RestController`/`@RequestMapping` handles HTTP methods.

**Summary (5 lines):**
Spring Boot simplifies building RESTful services with embedded server and autoconfiguration. Define entities, repositories, services, and controllers. It supports JSON serialization via Jackson. CRUD operations are exposed via HTTP endpoints. Standard HTTP status codes (200, 201, 204, 404) guide client-server interaction.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class App { public static void main(String[] args){SpringApplication.run(App.class,args);} }

@Entity class User { @Id @GeneratedValue long id; String name; /*get/set*/ }

@Repository interface UserRepo extends JpaRepository<User,Long> {}

@Service class UserService { @Autowired UserRepo repo;
    List<User> listAll(){return repo.findAll();} }

@RestController @RequestMapping("/users")
class UserCtrl {
    @Autowired UserService svc;
    @GetMapping List<User> getAll(){return svc.listAll();}
    /* other CRUD... */
}
```

**Interview Qs:**

1. **Q:** Why use layered architecture in Spring?
   **A:** Separates concerns (controller, service, repository), improves testability and maintainability.
2. **Q:** What auto-configuration does Spring Boot provide?
   **A:** AutoConfigurer sets up embedded server, data source, Jackson, JPA without manual XML config.
3. **Q:** How to enable hot-reload in development?
   **A:** Use Spring DevTools dependency; it restarts context on changes.

---

## 2. **Introduction to REST Services**

* **Use case:** Standardize communication in distributed apps via HTTP-based services.
* REST uses resources identified by URLs and methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
* Supports stateless interaction; each request carries all needed info.
* Uses JSON/XML for request/response bodies, content negotiation via `Accept`/`Content-Type`.
* Principles include HATEOAS, uniform interface, layered system.

**Summary:**
REST architecture is resource-based, stateless, and uses HTTP methods semantically. Clients negotiate formats via headers. Resources are named using nouns in endpoints. Good REST APIs use appropriate status codes and optionally hypermedia. Ideal for microservices and decoupled client-server systems.

```java
@RestController @RequestMapping("/books")
class BookCtrl {
  @GetMapping List<Book> all(){…}
  @GetMapping("/{id}") ResponseEntity<Book> one(@PathVariable Long id){…}
}
```

**Interview Qs:**

1. **Q:** What is statelessness in REST?
   **A:** Server doesn't store client context; every request contains all info to serve it.
2. **Q:** Why use appropriate HTTP status codes?
   **A:** To convey operation result: 200 OK, 201 Created, 404 Not Found, etc.
3. **Q:** What is HATEOAS?
   **A:** Hypermedia links embedded in responses guide clients on available actions dynamically.

---

## 3. **Build REST services using Spring MVC style & @ResponseBody annotation - Theory**

* **Use case:** Traditional Spring MVC controller returning JSON without `@RestController`.
* `@Controller` with `@ResponseBody` on methods converts Java objects to JSON via message converters.
* Each method mapped to HTTP endpoints via `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, etc.
* JSON/XML determined by client's `Accept` header and set of converters ([reddit.com][3], [spring.io][4], [codingeasypeasy.com][5], [en.wikipedia.org][6]).
* Advantage: Fine-grained separation between MVC views and REST JSON endpoints.

**Summary:**
With Spring MVC, add `@ResponseBody` to serialize method returns into HTTP response bodies. Used when only specific methods need JSON while others render views. Control serialization via `Accept` header negotiation. Gives flexibility in mixed web applications. Requires manual use of annotation on each returning method.

```java
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class ApiCtrl {
  @ResponseBody @GetMapping("/ping") public Ping ping(){return new Ping("pong");}
}
```

**Interview Qs:**

1. **Q:** Difference between `@Controller` and `@RestController`?
   **A:** `@RestController` = `@Controller` + `@ResponseBody` on all methods.
2. **Q:** How does Spring choose JSON vs XML?
   **A:** Based on `Accept` header and available `HttpMessageConverter`s.
3. **Q:** When choose `@Controller + @ResponseBody` over `@RestController`?
   **A:** When mixing view-rendering and endpoint methods.

---

Great! I’ll continue with the remaining topics in the same format:

---

## 4. **Implement REST service using Spring MVC style & `@ResponseBody`**

* **Use case:** Expose CRUD endpoints in a Spring MVC controller without switching to REST-only controllers.
* Methods annotated with `@ResponseBody` return JSON/XML, and `@PathVariable` / `@RequestParam` extract inputs.
* Use `@RequestBody` to deserialize JSON request to domain objects.
* Leverage `ResponseEntity<T>` to wrap return value and set HTTP status.
* You manage error responses manually or with exception handlers.

**Summary:**
In this approach, same MVC controller class can serve both web pages and REST endpoints by selectively annotating methods with `@ResponseBody`. Enables JSON serialization via Jackson converters. Input binding uses `@PathVariable`, `@RequestParam`, and `@RequestBody`. Responses (and statuses) can be controlled explicitly via `ResponseEntity`. Still requires boilerplate on each method.

```java
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {
  @Autowired UserService svc;

  @ResponseBody
  @GetMapping("/{id}")
  public ResponseEntity<User> getUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
    return svc.findById(id)
      .map(u -> ResponseEntity.ok(u))
      .orElse(ResponseEntity.notFound().build());
  }

  @ResponseBody
  @PostMapping
  public ResponseEntity<User> create(@RequestBody User u) {
    User saved = svc.save(u);
    return ResponseEntity.status(201).body(saved);
  }
}
```

**Interview Qs:**

1. **Q:** How to return a 404 status using `@ResponseBody`?
   **A:** Use `ResponseEntity.notFound().build()` in method.
2. **Q:** How do you bind JSON request body to Java object?
   **A:** Use `@RequestBody` on method parameter.
3. **Q:** How does Spring know to serialize return object to JSON?
   **A:** Message converters like Jackson, chosen based on `Accept` header.

---

## 5. **Deep dive & Demo of `@RequestBody` annotation**

* **Use case:** Accepting complex JSON payloads from clients for create/update operations.
* `@RequestBody` maps JSON in request body into Java objects (using Jackson, Gson, etc.).
* Support validation by combining with `@Valid` and binding results with `BindingResult`.
* Handles nested objects, lists, and proper type conversion.
* Supports content negotiation: Spring chooses parsing converter based on `Content-Type`.

**Summary:**
`@RequestBody` lets your controller accept full JSON payloads automatically deserialized to Java objects. You can validate the input using `@Valid`, `@NotNull`, etc., and check binding errors. Nested structures such as lists and embedded objects are handled naturally. Incorrect types cause `HttpMessageNotReadableException`. You can customize converters globally.

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/orders")
public class OrderController {
  @PostMapping
  public ResponseEntity<Order> create(@Valid @RequestBody OrderRequest req, BindingResult br) {
    if (br.hasErrors()) {
      return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(null);
    }
    Order saved = svc.create(req);
    return ResponseEntity.status(201).body(saved);
  }
}
```

**Interview Qs:**

1. **Q:** What happens if JSON in `@RequestBody` doesn’t match Java type?
   **A:** Spring throws `HttpMessageNotReadableException`, often leading to 400 response.
2. **Q:** How do you validate request body automatically?
   **A:** Use `@Valid` on the `@RequestBody` parameter and check `BindingResult`.
3. **Q:** Can you use `@RequestBody` with form-encoded data?
   **A:** No, that requires `@ModelAttribute` or `@RequestParam`, JSON requires `Content-Type: application/json`.

---

## 6. **Implement REST Services using `@RestController` annotation**

* **Use case:** Simplified REST-oriented controllers without mixing view rendering.
* `@RestController` implies `@Controller + @ResponseBody` on all methods by default.
* Enables clean class-level annotation, reducing clutter.
* Works well with Spring Boot auto-configuration for REST.
* Methods return objects or `ResponseEntity`, serialized to JSON/XML.

**Summary:**
Using `@RestController` streamlines creation of controllers meant purely for REST. All methods automatically return JSON (or other content). You don’t need to put `@ResponseBody` individually. Works seamlessly with `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, etc. Cleaner boilerplate and easier to maintain.

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/products")
public class ProductController {
  @Autowired ProductService svc;
  
  @GetMapping("/{id}")
  public ResponseEntity<Product> get(@PathVariable Long id) {
    return svc.find(id)
      .map(p -> ResponseEntity.ok(p))
      .orElse(ResponseEntity.notFound().build());
  }
  
  @PostMapping
  public ResponseEntity<Product> create(@RequestBody Product p) {
    return ResponseEntity.status(201).body(svc.save(p));
  }
}
```

**Interview Qs:**

1. **Q:** What’s the difference between `@Controller` and `@RestController`?
   **A:** `@RestController` treats every method as if it had `@ResponseBody`, removing need to annotate each.
2. **Q:** How to support XML responses with `@RestController`?
   **A:** Ensure Jackson XML converter or JAXB in classpath; client sends `Accept: application/xml`.
3. **Q:** How do you return custom HTTP status codes?
   **A:** Return `ResponseEntity<T>` configured with desired status.

---

## 7. **Demo of save operation using Rest Service & `ResponseEntity`**

* **Use case:** Persisting new resource via POST and returning appropriate status and headers.
* POST endpoint consumes JSON, creates new record via service or repository.
* Use `ResponseEntity.created(URI).body(savedEntity)` to set status 201 and Location header.
* URI often built with `ServletUriComponentsBuilder`.
* Body returns saved entity, including generated ID.

**Summary:**
Save operation usually accepts JSON via POST, persists via service, then responds with 201 Created, sets `Location` header pointing to resource URI, and returns the created resource in the body. `ResponseEntity` gives full control over status code and headers. It's best practice in REST to include the location of the new resource.

```java
@PostMapping
public ResponseEntity<User> createUser(@RequestBody User u) {
  User saved = svc.save(u);
  URI location = ServletUriComponentsBuilder.fromCurrentRequest()
    .path("/{id}").buildAndExpand(saved.getId()).toUri();
  return ResponseEntity.created(location).body(saved);
}
```

**Interview Qs:**

1. **Q:** How do you return `Location` header after creating a resource?
   **A:** Build URI e.g. via `ServletUriComponentsBuilder`, then `ResponseEntity.created(uri)`.
2. **Q:** What status code should you return after successful creation?
   **A:** 201 Created.
3. **Q:** Why return the newly created object?
   **A:** So client has access to generated fields (e.g. ID), reflecting server state.

---

## 8. **Demo of delete operation using Rest Service & `RequestEntity`**

* **Use case:** Allow clients to delete a resource by sending DELETE request and body or headers.
* Use `@DeleteMapping` and optionally accept `RequestEntity<Void>` or payload if needed for additional info.
* Use service logic to confirm existence and remove resource.
* Return appropriate HTTP status: 204 No Content for successful deletion, or 404 if missing.
* Use `ResponseEntity<Void>` for cleaner no-body responses.

**Summary:**
DELETE endpoints remove specified resource by ID. You can access headers or body via `RequestEntity`, though usually not needed. After deletion, respond with 204 No Content to indicate success without body. If resource not found, send 404. `RequestEntity` allows reading request metadata when needed.

```java
@DeleteMapping("/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<Void> deleteUser(@PathVariable Long id, RequestEntity<Void> req) {
  boolean existed = svc.deleteById(id);
  return existed ? ResponseEntity.noContent().build() : ResponseEntity.notFound().build();
}
```

**Interview Qs:**

1. **Q:** What's the usual status code for a successful delete?
   **A:** 204 No Content.
2. **Q:** When would you use `RequestEntity` in DELETE handler?
   **A:** If you need access to headers or request body metadata.
3. **Q:** If the resource doesn’t exist, which status?
   **A:** 404 Not Found.

---

## 9. **Demo of update operation using Rest Service & recap of all REST annotations**

* **Use case:** Support full or partial updates via PUT/PATCH.
* Use `@PutMapping` (or `@PatchMapping`) plus `@RequestBody` to receive update DTO.
* Validate incoming data; if resource exists, update and return 200 OK with body.
* If creating new on PUT semantics, return 201 Created; otherwise 404 if not found.
* Summary of annotations: `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@PatchMapping`, `@DeleteMapping`, `@RequestBody`, `@ResponseBody`, `@PathVariable`, `@RequestParam`.

**Summary:**
The update API typically uses PUT (full replace) or PATCH (partial). You receive input via `@RequestBody` and bind path via `@PathVariable`. If update succeeds, usually return 200 OK with updated resource. Missing resources may return 404. PUT can also upsert, returning 201 Created. Annotational recap shows all key REST method-level mappings and body/path bindings.

```java
@PutMapping("/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<User> updateUser(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody User u) {
  return svc.update(id, u)
    .map(updated -> ResponseEntity.ok(updated))
    .orElse(ResponseEntity.notFound().build());
}
```

**Interview Qs:**

1. **Q:** Put vs Patch: what's the difference?
   **A:** PUT replaces the entity fully; PATCH applies partial changes.
2. **Q:** Which annotations define REST method handlers?
   **A:** `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@PatchMapping`, `@DeleteMapping`, etc.
3. **Q:** How do you bind query parameters?
   **A:** Use `@RequestParam`.

---

## 10. **Implement global error logic for REST Services using `@RestControllerAdvice`**

* **Use case:** Centralized exception handling across all REST controllers.
* Define a class annotated with `@RestControllerAdvice`; inside, use `@ExceptionHandler` to catch exceptions.
* Methods return `ResponseEntity<ErrorDTO>` with custom error codes and messages.
* Handle validation errors (`MethodArgumentNotValidException`), `HttpMessageNotReadableException`, custom exceptions.
* Log errors and optionally include timestamp, path, and error details in a structured error response.

**Summary:**
`@RestControllerAdvice` allows interception of exceptions thrown by controllers and return consistent error responses. You can catch specific exceptions and map them to HTTP status codes and error bodies. It helps avoid repetitive error handling logic in controllers. Error DTOs can include fields like timestamp, status, message, path, etc. Improves API client consistency and maintainability.

```java
@RestControllerAdvice
public class GlobalErrorHandler {
  @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class)
  public ResponseEntity<ErrorDTO> handleValidation(MethodArgumentNotValidException ex, HttpServletRequest req) {
    String msg = ex.getBindingResult().getFieldErrors().stream()
      .map(e -> e.getField() + ": " + e.getDefaultMessage())
      .collect(Collectors.joining("; "));
    ErrorDTO err = new ErrorDTO(LocalDateTime.now(), 400, "Validation failed", msg, req.getRequestURI());
    return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(err);
  }

  @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
  public ResponseEntity<ErrorDTO> handleNotFound(ResourceNotFoundException ex, HttpServletRequest req) {
    ErrorDTO err = new ErrorDTO(LocalDateTime.now(), 404, "Not found", ex.getMessage(), req.getRequestURI());
    return ResponseEntity.status(404).body(err);
  }
}
```

**Interview Qs:**

1. **Q:** Why use `@RestControllerAdvice`?
   **A:** To centralize and standardize error handling across controllers.
2. **Q:** How handle validation errors globally?
   **A:** Catch `MethodArgumentNotValidException` in a handler method and build error DTO.
3. **Q:** What structure should a typical error response contain?
   **A:** Timestamp, status code, error message, details, request path.

## 1. Deep dive on **CROSS-ORIGIN RESOURCE SHARING (CORS)** & `@CrossOrigin` annotation

### ✅ Real‑time Web Use‑Case

Suppose a React frontend served from `http://localhost:3000` needs to call your Spring Boot API at `http://localhost:8080/api/data`. Browsers block this by default—CORS lets you allow it.

### 🔍 Key Points

* Enables frontends on different origins to safely access your APIs.
* Configurable at controller, method, or global level in Spring.
* Support for preflight (`OPTIONS`) requests with headers like `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`.
* `@CrossOrigin(origins = "...")` automatically sets needed CORS headers.
* You can whitelist specific domains, restrict methods, and set allowed headers.

### 📝 5‑line Summary

Spring’s CORS support allows cross-origin requests from approved origins.
Use `@CrossOrigin` on controllers or globally via `WebMvcConfigurer`.
Preflight `OPTIONS` calls are handled automatically.
You can tailor policies: allowed origins, methods, headers, credentials.
Helps React, Angular, Vue frontends call Spring APIs without browser errors.

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/data")
@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:3000")
public class DataController {
    @GetMapping
    public List<String> getData() { return List.of("Java","Spring","CORS"); }
}
```

### 🧠 Interview Questions

1. **Q: What is CORS and why is it needed?**
   **A:** CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing; it's a browser security model that blocks webpages from calling APIs in other domains unless explicitly allowed, preventing malicious cross-site calls.

2. **Q: How do you enable CORS globally in Spring Boot?**
   **A:** Implement `WebMvcConfigurer` and override `addCorsMappings()`, e.g.:

   ```java
   registry.addMapping("/**").allowedOrigins("*").allowedMethods("GET","POST");
   ```

3. **Q: What’s the difference between `@CrossOrigin` and global config?**
   **A:** `@CrossOrigin` is more granular (applies at class/method level), while global config in `WebMvcConfigurer` applies across all controllers.

## 2. Sending Response in XML Format in REST Services

### ✅ Use‑Case

Clients integrating with legacy systems often expect XML payloads rather than JSON (e.g., from SOAP-based clients).

### 🔍 Key Points

* Add Jackson XML dependency (`jackson-dataformat-xml`).
* Annotate DTOs with `@XmlRootElement`, `@JacksonXmlProperty`.
* In controller, add `produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_XML_VALUE`.
* Spring auto-converts objects into XML strings.
* Clients see `<customer><id>...</id><name>...</name></customer>` format.

### 📝 5‑line Summary

Adding Jackson XML support enables Spring to serialize responses to XML.
DTOs are annotated to map fields into XML elements.
Controller methods specify `produces=application/xml`.
The message converter handles the transformation automatically.
Useful for interoperability with systems requiring XML.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat</groupId>
  <artifactId>jackson-dataformat-xml</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

```java
@XmlRootElement(name = "customer")
public class Customer { private Long id; private String name; /* getters/setters */ }

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/xml")
public class XmlController {
  @GetMapping(value = "/cust/{id}", produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_XML_VALUE)
  public Customer getCust(@PathVariable Long id) { return new Customer(id, "Alice"); }
}
```

### 🧠 Interview Questions

1. **Q: What dependency do you need to produce XML?**
   **A:** `com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-xml`.

2. **Q: How do you specify a method returns XML in Spring?**
   **A:** Use `@GetMapping(value="...", produces=MediaType.APPLICATION_XML_VALUE)`.

3. **Q: How do you control element names in XML output?**
   **A:** Annotate with JAXB/Jackson XML annotations, like `@XmlRootElement(name="cust")` or `@JacksonXmlProperty(localName="custId")`.

## 1. Logging Configurations inside Spring Boot

### Use Case Example

* You need dynamic control over log levels per package at runtime for production debugging.
* Use application‑properties or external config to adjust without redeploy.
* Set console vs file, and advanced appenders via logback‑spring.xml.

**Explanation**

1. Spring Boot integrates Logback by default via `spring-boot-starter-logging` or web starter ([Reddit][1], [Home][2], [Home][3]).
2. You can override log levels in `application.properties` using `logging.level.{package}=DEBUG|INFO|ERROR` ([Home][3]).
3. File logging is enabled via `logging.file.name` or `logging.file.path` properties ([Home][2]).
4. For advanced setups, provide a custom `logback-spring.xml` and override appenders or patterns ([Home][3]).
5. Spring Boot substitutes variables like `${LOG_FILE}`, `${PID}`, `${LOG_PATH}` in your logback config ([Home][3]).

**Summary**
Spring Boot’s logging is powered by Logback and easily controlled via external properties or YAML. You can adjust log levels per package without modifying code. Logs can be written to console and rotated files by setting built-in application properties. For complex output formatting, include a custom `logback-spring.xml`. Variables and system-substituted values let you reuse placeholders for paths, file names, and process IDs.

```properties
# application.properties
logging.level.com.myapp.service=DEBUG
logging.level.org.springframework=INFO
logging.file.name=app.log
```

```xml
<!-- logback-spring.xml -->
<configuration>
  <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/defaults.xml"/>
  <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/file-appender.xml"/>
  <root level="INFO"><appender-ref ref="FILE"/></root>
  <logger name="com.myapp.service" level="DEBUG"/>
</configuration>
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. *How to change log level at runtime without redeploy?*

   * Use externalized `application.properties` or environment variables (e.g. `logging.level.my.package=DEBUG`) and restart or via actuator.
2. *What is `rolling-file-name-pattern`?*

   * It configures how logback rotates files—via Spring Boot built-in variables `${ROLLING_FILE_NAME_PATTERN}`.
3. *Difference between `logback.xml` and `logback-spring.xml`?*

   * `logback-spring.xml` enables Spring Boot extensions and property substitution; plain `logback.xml` is standard.

---

## 2. Introduction to Logging inside Spring Boot

### Use Case Example

* A new REST API project where you want structured logs at INFO, warn errors, tracing user actions.

**Explanation**

1. Spring Boot uses Commons Logging facade (`spring-jcl`) with a default Logback implementation ([Home][3], [Reddit][4]).
2. Out‑of‑the‑box it logs to console at INFO level and higher unless configured otherwise .
3. You can enable `--debug` or `--trace` mode via command line or properties to increase verbosity ([Home][2]).
4. ANSI color-coded console output helps readability—configurable via `spring.output.ansi.enabled` ([Home][2]).
5. Log format patterns (timestamp, level, thread, logger, message) come from defaults unless overwritten via config.

**Summary**
Spring Boot’s logging infrastructure uses `spring-jcl` and Logback to provide console logging by default at INFO/WARN/ERROR levels. Debug or trace modes can be enabled via command-line flags (`--debug`, `--trace`) or properties. The console output includes ANSI colors and a standard pattern, easily customized. No extra dependency is needed if you include `spring-boot-starter-web`. You can further fine-tune via configuration or custom logger files.

```properties
# Enable debug mode
debug=true
spring.output.ansi.enabled=always
```

```java
private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyController.class);
log.info("Incoming request: {}", request);
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. *What does `--debug` flag do in Spring Boot?*

   * It triggers debug-enabled core loggers (embedded container, Hibernate, etc.), not all classes.
2. *How do you disable ANSI colors?*

   * Set `spring.output.ansi.enabled=never` or `detect`.
3. *Which logging facade does Spring Boot use?*

   * It uses Commons Logging via `spring-jcl`, with Logback as default backend.

---

## 3. Logging configurations for Spring Boot framework code

### Use Case Example

* You want to see fine-grained Hibernate SQL logs and Spring MVC request mapping logs to debug slow endpoints.

**Explanation**

1. Spring Boot allows per-framework-package log-level control using `logging.level.*`, e.g., `org.hibernate.SQL`, `org.springframework.web`.
2. In `application.properties`, you set `logging.level.org.hibernate.SQL=DEBUG` to see SQL queries ([Home][3], [Home][2]).
3. You can also adjust `logging.pattern.console` or custom appenders for framework logs via custom config files.
4. Using profiles, you can enable verbose logging only in dev, e.g., `application-dev.properties`.
5. These settings act on the framework layer and won't affect your application package unless explicitly included.

**Summary**
To debug framework internals in Spring Boot, use `logging.level` for specific framework packages like Hibernate or Spring MVC. You can tailor log patterns or use profiles for environment-based verbosity. This doesn't clutter your application logs unless desired. The approach works consistently across packaged JARs and external configs.

```properties
# application.properties
logging.level.org.hibernate.SQL=DEBUG
logging.level.org.springframework.web=TRACE
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. *How to enable SQL logs from Hibernate?*

   * Set `logging.level.org.hibernate.SQL=DEBUG` and optionally `org.hibernate.type.descriptor.sql=TRACE`.
2. *How to limit logging changes to a specific environment?*

   * Use Spring profiles such as `application-dev.properties` and activate it via `spring.profiles.active=dev`.
3. *What is the effect of setting `logging.level.root=ERROR`?*

   * It overrides all other logger defaults, limiting global logging to ERROR level unless individually overridden.

---

## 4. Logging configurations for Application code

### Use Case Example

* For your microservice package `com.myapp`, you want application-level logs at DEBUG but keep dependencies quiet.

**Explanation**

1. You define your own package logger via `logging.level.com.myapp=DEBUG`.
2. A custom `logback-spring.xml` can configure multiple appenders (console + file) for your package only.
3. You can filter or route logs from different packages to separate files using `TurboFilter` or `SiftingAppender`.
4. Application logs can include context (MDC) to enrich entries with request ID or user ID.
5. You can implement structured logging (JSON) via custom encoder in logback config.

**Summary**
Application logging in Spring Boot is customizable by package: enable debug/detail only for your own code packages. You can route those logs to files or enrich them with context data using MDC. For structured output, configure JSON formatting in Logback. This approach isolates your logs from framework noise and improves observability.

```properties
logging.level.com.myapp=DEBUG
```

```java
MDC.put("requestId", requestId);
log.debug("Processing business logic");
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. *How do you add request-specific context to logs?*

   * Use MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) and include `%X{key}` in your logback pattern.
2. *How to log your code separately to another file?*

   * Use a custom `logback-spring.xml` with `SiftingAppender` or separate logger configurations.
3. *How to emit logs in JSON format?*

   * Configure a Logback encoder (e.g. `LogstashEncoder`) in `logback-spring.xml`.

---

## 5. Store log statements into a custom file and folder

### Use Case Example

* You want all application logs written into an organized folder, e.g., `/var/log/myapp/`, naming by date.

**Explanation**

1. Set `logging.file.path=/var/log/myapp` or `logging.file.name=/var/log/myapp/myapp.log` ([Reddit][5], [Reddit][6], [Home][3], [Medium][7]).
2. For rotating logs, use `logback‑spring.xml` with file‑appender and `ROLLING_FILE_NAME_PATTERN` variable ([Home][3]).
3. Configure the pattern to include timestamp in the log file name.
4. You can disable console logging entirely by omitting console-appender include.
5. Directory must exist or have proper permissions; configure fallback temp dir if needed via `${java.io.tmpdir}` placeholder.

**Summary**
Define log file path or specific name in `application.properties` to direct logs into your desired folder. Use a custom `logback-spring.xml` to enable rolling appender and timestamped filenames. You may disable console output if needed. Spring Boot facilitates placeholders like `${LOG_PATH}` and `${LOG_FILE}` for integration.

```properties
logging.file.path=/var/log/myapp
```

```xml
<configuration>
  <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/defaults.xml"/>
  <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/file-appender.xml"/>
  <root level="INFO"><appender-ref ref="FILE"/></root>
</configuration>
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. *Difference between `logging.file.name` and `logging.file.path`?*

   * name sets exact file; path sets directory defaulting file name `spring.log`. Name overrides path.
2. *How to configure log rotation by size/time?*

   * Use logback's RollingFileAppender in `logback-spring.xml` with appropriate `<rollingPolicy>`.
3. *What if the configured log directory does not exist?*

   * Spring Boot may fail to write; ensure directory exists or use fallback via `${LOG_TEMP}` or `java.io.tmpdir`.

---

## 6. "Logging Configurations inside SpringBoot" Quiz

**Quiz**

1. Which property enables file logging?

   * **Answer:** `logging.file.name` or `logging.file.path`.
2. What is the purpose of `logback-spring.xml` vs `logback.xml`?

   * **Answer:** Allows Spring Boot property substitution and extensions.
3. How do you enable SQL logging for Hibernate?

   * **Answer:** Set `logging.level.org.hibernate.SQL=DEBUG`.

---

## 7. Properties Configuration & Profiles inside Spring Boot

### Use Case Example

* You maintain dev, test, prod environments with different DB URLs, logging levels, and feature toggles.

**Explanation**

1. Use `application.properties` (or YAML) plus `application-{profile}.properties` for environment overrides ([Home][3], [Home][2], [Home][8]).
2. Set active profile via `spring.profiles.active=dev` or env var, system property, or command line ([Medium][7]).
3. Spring respects property source precedence (command line → env vars → external files → internal jar) ([Home][8]).
4. Profiles can include selective beans via `@Profile` annotation.
5. Use `@ConfigurationProperties` to bind typed configuration to POJOs with validation support ([Baeldung][9]).

**Summary**
Spring Boot properties and profiles enable flexible environment-specific configuration. Use base `application.properties` plus overrides in `application-dev.properties`. Activate profiles via command-line, env var, or system property. The property source ordering defines precedence. Finally, use `@ConfigurationProperties` to inject structured configs into beans with validation support.

```properties
spring.profiles.active=dev
```

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:dev-url
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. *Order of property precedence in Spring Boot?*

   * Command-line args highest, then system props, env vars, external files, then jar, then defaults.
2. *How do you activate a Spring profile?*

   * Via `spring.profiles.active` property (env var, system property, or config).
3. *What benefits `@ConfigurationProperties` vs `@Value`?*

   * Binds hierarchical properties into POJOs, allows validation and type safety.

---

## 8. Introduction to Externalized properties inside Spring Boot Web Applications

### Use Case Example

* You deploy a Spring Boot WAR inside different servers and want to externalize configs (port, DB credentials) per environment without repackaging the jar.

**Explanation**

1. Spring Boot supports external `application.properties` located outside the JAR under `/config` or current directory ([Medium][7]).
2. You can override location using `--spring.config.location` or `spring.config.import` for multiple files or directories ([Medium][10]).
3. Environment variables and command-line args override file values.
4. Spring Boot 2.4+ introduced Config Data API and `spring.config.import` support for config servers or external files ([Medium][10]).
5. This ensures sensitive or environment-specific config stays outside the code and easily changed without rebuilding.

**Summary**
Externalized properties allow Spring Boot web apps to load configurations from files outside the packaged jar (e.g. `/config` folder). You can explicitly set configuration locations using `spring.config.location` or import via `spring.config.import`. External sources include properties, YAML, environment variables, and even config servers. This makes it easier to manage environment and secret configurations without code change or rebuild.

```bash
java -jar app.jar --spring.config.location=./config/application.properties
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. *How to load external config file not packaged inside JAR?*

   * Use `--spring.config.location=path` or `spring.config.import=optional:file:...`.
2. *What is Config Data API in Spring Boot 2.4+?*

   * New mechanism for importing configuration from external sources like config servers using `spring.config.import`.
3. *Why externalize configs instead of packaging them?*

   * Enables environment-specific configuration, hides secrets, avoids rebuilds, simplifies deployments.

Here are detailed answers with real-time use-case examples, explanations, summaries with code, and interview questions for each topic:

---

## 1. Reading properties using `@Value` annotation

### 🔹 Use-case example

```java
@Component
public class AppConfig {
    @Value("${app.name}")
    private String appName;

    @Value("${app.timeout:30}")
    private int timeout;
    
    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        System.out.println("App: " + appName + ", Timeout: " + timeout);
    }
}
```

### ✅ 5 bullet-point explanations

* `@Value("${property}")` injects values from `application.properties` into fields.
* Supports default fallback via `:${default}` syntax.
* Can inject SpEL expressions like `@Value("#{systemProperties['user.name']}")`.
* Only supports simple types (primitives, Strings, enums); no POJOs.
* Injection happens during bean creation—fields must not be `final`.

### 📋 5-line summary

`@Value` is a quick way to inject simple properties directly into fields. Great for one-off values like titles or timeouts. It supports default values and expressions but isn't suited for grouping related settings. Overuse can scatter configuration throughout code. Best for small, standalone properties.

```java
@Component
public class AppConfig {
    @Value("${app.name}")
    private String appName;
    
    @Value("${app.timeout:30}")
    private int timeout;
}
```

### 🧠 Interview Q\&A

**Q1.** *Can `@Value` inject list/collection properties?*
**A:** Not directly. You can inject a comma-separated string and then split manually.

**Q2.** *What happens if a property is missing and no default is provided?*
**A:** Spring throws `IllegalArgumentException: Could not resolve placeholder...`.

**Q3.** *Is `@Value` type-safe?*
**A:** Only basic conversions are supported. It fails at runtime if conversion isn’t handled.

---

## 2. Reading properties using `Environment` interface

### 🔹 Use-case example

```java
@Component
public class EnvConfig {
    @Autowired
    private Environment env;

    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        String serviceUrl = env.getProperty("service.url");
        int retries = env.getProperty("service.retries", Integer.class, 3);
        System.out.println("URL: " + serviceUrl + ", Retries: " + retries);
    }
}
```

### ✅ 5 bullet-point explanations

* `Environment` gives programmatic access to all property sources.
* `getProperty(key, targetType, default)` allows type conversion and fallbacks.
* Good for conditional logic based on presence or value of properties.
* Access to active profiles using `env.getActiveProfiles()`.
* Lacks compile-time safety; property keys are prone to typos.

### 📋 5-line summary

Using `Environment` gives you flexible, code-level access to properties with types and defaults. Ideal when decisions or logic depend on configurations. Unlike `@Value`, it allows conditional flows but at the cost of verbosity and potential runtime errors. Not as clean for simple injection.

```java
@Autowired
private Environment env;

String url = env.getProperty("service.url");
int retries = env.getProperty("service.retries", Integer.class, 3);
```

### 🧠 Interview Q\&A

**Q1.** *How do you check if a property exists?*
**A:** Use `env.containsProperty("property.key")`.

**Q2.** *Can you get active profiles via `Environment`?*
**A:** Yes, via `env.getActiveProfiles()`.

**Q3.** *When to choose `Environment` over `@Value`?*
**A:** When needing conditional logic or runtime checks against config.

---

## 3. Reading properties using `@ConfigurationProperties` – Theory

### 🔹 Use-case example

No code yet.

### ✅ 5 bullet-point explanations

* Binds entire property groups into strongly typed POJOs.
* Supports nested structures and complex types (lists, maps).
* Enables validation via JSR-303 annotations like `@Valid`, `@NotNull`.
* Encourages centralized config management and modular design.
* Requires explicit `@EnableConfigurationProperties` or `@SpringBootApplication` auto-activation.

### 📋 5-line summary

`@ConfigurationProperties` maps groups of properties to POJOs for cohesive, type-safe access. Great for complex configurations (e.g., mail, server). Allows validation and clean separation of concerns. Though more boilerplate than `@Value`, it scales well for larger apps. Encourages reusable config components.

---

## 4. Reading properties using `@ConfigurationProperties` – Coding

### 🔹 Use-case example

```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "aws")
@Validated
public class AwsProperties {
    @NotBlank
    private String accessKey;
    private String secretKey;
    private Regions region = Regions.US_EAST_1;
    // getters/setters
}

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableConfigurationProperties(AwsProperties.class)
public class App {
    @Bean
    public AmazonS3 s3(AwsProperties props) {
        return AmazonS3ClientBuilder.standard()
            .withRegion(props.getRegion().name())
            .withCredentials(new AWSStaticCredentialsProvider(
              new BasicAWSCredentials(props.getAccessKey(), props.getSecretKey())))
            .build();
    }
}
```

### ✅ 5 bullet-point explanations

* `@ConfigurationProperties(prefix)` ties bean fields to grouped properties.
* `@Validated` triggers JSR‑303 validation when binding.
* Default values and type conversion work automatically.
* Clean bean injection enables robust usage across the app.
* Enables grouping of related config like "aws.access-key", "aws.secret-key".

### 📋 5-line summary

The AWS example binds credentials and region config cleanly and validates them. This pattern supports building beans that depend on complex config in a maintainable way. It keeps configuration centralized, type-checked, and easily testable. A best practice for enterprise-grade Spring Boot apps.

```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix="aws")
@Validated
public class AwsProperties { ... }
```

### 🧠 Interview Q\&A

**Q1.** *How do you validate `@ConfigurationProperties`?*
**A:** Add `@Validated` and JSR‑303 annotations, with `@EnableConfigurationProperties`.

**Q2.** *Can you bind a list of objects?*
**A:** Yes, define `List<YourObject>` with matching property format.

**Q3.** *When to choose `@ConfigurationProperties` over `@Value`?*
**A:** When binding structured config: nested, repeated, validated beans.

---

## 5. Introduction to Profiles in Spring

### 🔹 Use-case example

No code yet.

### ✅ 5 bullet-point explanations

* Profiles allow environment-specific configuration (e.g., dev, prod).
* Beans and configs can be activated only under specific profiles.
* Set e.g. `spring.profiles.active=dev` via properties or runtime.
* Use annotations like `@Profile("prod")` and `@Profile("!test")`.
* Enables easy switching and safe deployments.

### 📋 5-line summary

Profiles support flexible runtime environments like test, staging, production. They control which beans and config files are loaded. This gives separation of dev vs. prod concerns. Activation is easy via properties or environment variables. A fundamental tool for multi-environment applications.

---

## 6. Implementation & Demo of Profiles inside Eazy School Web App

### 🔹 Use-case example

```java
// application-dev.properties
app.mode=development
// application-prod.properties
app.mode=production

@Service
@Profile("dev")
public class DevEmailService implements EmailService {
    // ...dev email stub
}
@Service
@Profile("prod")
public class ProdEmailService implements EmailService {
    // ...real email sender
}

@RestController
public class HomeController {
    @Value("${app.mode}")
    private String mode;

    @GetMapping("/mode")
    public String mode() { return mode; }
}
```

### ✅ 5 bullet-point explanations

* Two property files loaded based on active profile.
* Two beans implementing the same interface, each annotated for dev/prod.
* `@Value` used to show which mode is active at runtime.
* Switch easily using `-Dspring.profiles.active=prod` or env variable.
* Demonstrates conditional wiring and runtime behavior swap.

### 📋 5-line summary

In the Eazy School app, email logic switches between stub (dev) and real sender (prod) based on active profile. The frontend shows current mode by reading from respective property files. This demonstrates Spring’s profile-driven injection of beans and config, making environment-targeted deployments seamless.

```java
@Service @Profile("dev") class DevEmailService implements EmailService { ... }
```

---

## 7. Various approaches to activate Profiles inside Spring

### ✅ 5 bullet-point explanations

* Via `application.properties`: `spring.profiles.active=dev,uat`
* Environment variable: `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod`
* JVM argument: `-Dspring.profiles.active=qa`
* Programmatically: `new SpringApplicationBuilder(App.class).profiles("test").run()`
* Kubernetes/Cloud: container deployment injects env var or config map

### 📋 5-line summary

Spring Boot offers multiple ways to select active profiles: via properties, env vars, JVM params, or programmatic code. This flexibility supports local dev, CI pipelines, and cloud deployments. Using profiles across environments ensures correct beans and configs load automatically. It’s best practice for robust deployment strategies.

---

## 8. Creating beans conditionally based on active profile

### 🔹 Use-case example

```java
@Configuration
public class DataSourceConfig {
    @Bean
    @Profile("dev")
    public DataSource h2DataSource() {
        return new EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder()
            .setType(EmbeddedDatabaseType.H2).build();
    }

    @Bean
    @Profile("prod")
    public DataSource mysqlDataSource() {
        return DataSourceBuilder.create()
            .url("jdbc:mysql://prod-db/myapp")
            .username("user").password("pass").build();
    }
}
```

### ✅ 5 bullet-point explanations

* Conditional bean registration via `@Profile`.
* Switch between H2 embedded vs MySQL based on environment.
* Only one bean present in the application context at runtime.
* Prevents accidental use of production resources in dev.
* Maintains single codebase with environment-specific wiring.

### 📋 5-line summary

Conditional bean creation based on profile avoids runtime misconfiguration. The example shows H2 vs MySQL data sources depending on `dev` or `prod` profiles. It centralizes environment logic and simplifies deployment-by-declaration. This approach scales to any conditional bean, improving safety and clarity.

## 9. **"Properties Configuration & Profiles inside Spring Boot" Quiz**

Here’s a quick quiz to test your knowledge:

### 1. Which annotation groups related config properties into a POJO?

**Answer:** `@ConfigurationProperties`

### 2. Can `@Value` inject a list like `my.list=1,2,3` directly as `List<Integer>`?

**Answer:** No — it injects a String; you must split/convert manually.

### 3. Which property file is automatically loaded given `spring.profiles.active=prod`?

**Answer:** `application-prod.properties` (merged with `application.properties`)

### 4. True or False: Beans annotated with `@Profile("dev")` are always loaded regardless of profile.

**Answer:** False — they are loaded only when `dev` is active.

### 5. Where can you set `spring.profiles.active`?

* `application.properties`
* JVM args (e.g. `-Dspring.profiles.active=...`)
* Environment variables (`SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE`)
* Programmatically (e.g. `SpringApplicationBuilder`)

## 1. Deep Dive on Spring Boot Actuator & Spring Boot Admin

### Use-case coding example

```java
// application.yml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health, info, metrics
  endpoint:
    health:
      show-details: always
```

### 5 bullet point explanations

* Enables built‑in endpoints (`/actuator/health`, `/actuator/metrics`, `/actuator/info`).
* Use `show-details: always` to expose granular health info.
* You can selectively expose endpoints for security.
* Works with Spring Boot Admin for centralized monitoring.
* Useful in microservices to surface health, metrics, environment, etc.

### 5-line summary + code

Spring Boot Actuator provides production-grade web endpoints for monitoring your Spring Boot app. You configure which endpoints to expose and secure them appropriately. Spring Boot Admin then aggregates and visualizes these endpoints via a central UI. This combo is ideal for microservice observability.

```yaml
management:
  server:
    port: 8081
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: "*"
  endpoint:
    health:
      show-details: always
```

### Interview Q\&A

**Q1: What is Spring Boot Actuator?**
A: A Spring Boot extension that exposes operational endpoints to aid in monitoring and managing an app—health, metrics, thread dump, etc.

**Q2: How does Spring Boot Admin communicate with your app?**
A: It uses HTTP/S to poll Actuator endpoints; apps register themselves via Spring Boot Admin client or discovery.

**Q3: How do you secure Actuator endpoints?**
A: Use `management.endpoints.web.exposure` and Spring Security config to restrict endpoints to specific roles or IPs.

---

## 2. Introduction to Spring Boot Actuator

### Use-case coding example

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class App {
  public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(App.class, args); }
}
```

```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info
info.app.name=EazySchool
info.app.version=1.0.0
```

### Bullet points

* Minimal setup: Spring Boot starter just works.
* Exposes `/actuator/health` and custom `/actuator/info`.
* Info endpoint populated via properties as shown.
* No extra code needed for basics.
* Good jump‑start for app monitoring.

### Summary + code

Actuator is plug‑and‑play: adding the starter and an `application.properties` entry gives instant insights. Health and info endpoints give status and metadata. From here, you can customize and extend to add metrics, environment, etc.

```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,env,metrics
```

## 3. Implement and Secure Actuator inside Eazy School Web App

### Use-case coding example

```java
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
  @Override protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
      .authorizeRequests()
        .requestMatchers(EndpointRequest.to("health", "info")).permitAll()
        .requestMatchers(EndpointRequest.toAnyEndpoint()).hasRole("ADMIN")
      .and()
      .httpBasic();
  }
}
```

### Bullet points

* Use `EndpointRequest` to secure endpoints granularly.
* Open health/info for public, rest require ADMIN.
* Basic auth protects the endpoints.
* Integrates Spring Security easily.
* Keeps non‑admin users from seeing sensitive data.

### Summary + code

To secure Actuator in Eazy School, use `EndpointRequest` and Spring Security to customize access. Make public endpoints available, and require authentication for others. Simple and effective security policy.

```java
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
```

```properties
spring.security.user.name=admin
spring.security.user.password=secret
```

### Q\&A

**Q1: How to allow only ADMIN to access metrics?**
A: Use `requestMatchers(EndpointRequest.to("metrics")).hasRole("ADMIN")`.

**Q2: Is BASIC auth enough in production?**
A: Typically not—use OAuth2 or integrate with corporate SSO.

**Q3: Can I disable security only for actuator?**
A: Yes, but only safe if actuator is not publicly exposed.

## 4. Deepdive of Actuator endpoints

### Use-case coding example

```java
@Bean
public MeterBinder myCustomMetrics() {
  return registry -> registry.counter("eazy.count", "service", "student").increment();
}
```

### Bullet points

* `health`: aggregates health indicators.
* `metrics`: collects JVM, GC, CPU, HTTP, and custom metrics.
* `info`: displays version, build, etc.
* `beans`: lists Spring beans.
* `env`: exposes configuration key-values.

### Summary + code

Actuator offers powerful endpoints: `metrics` for performance, `beans` for insight into application context, `env` for config debugging, and more. You can register custom metrics with `MeterBinder` or health checks via `HealthIndicator`.

```java
@Component
public class DatabaseHealthIndicator implements HealthIndicator {
  public Health health() {
    return checkDb() ? Health.up().build() : Health.down().withDetail("Error","Timeout").build();
  }
}
```

### Q\&A

**Q1: How to add custom health check?**
A: Implement `HealthIndicator` and register it as a bean.

**Q2: How to access HTTP request metrics?**
A: Ensure `spring-boot-starter-actuator` + `micrometer-core`, exposed via `meterRegistry`.

**Q3: Can endpoints be disabled?**
A: Yes—set `management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=<endpoint>`.

## 5. Exploring Actuator data using Spring Boot Admin

### Use-case coding example

```yaml
spring:
  boot:
    admin:
      client:
        url: http://localhost:9090
        username: admin
        password: secret
```

### Bullet points

* Spring Boot App registers with Admin server.
* Admin UI displays endpoints from all apps.
* Offers health, metrics, loggers, and mappings.
* Real‑time status and alerting.
* Central web dashboard for clusters.

### Summary + code

Spring Boot Admin aggregates multiple apps’ Actuator data into a central UI. Clients register with the server and show metrics, health, environment, and perform remote actions. Great for managing microservice fleets.

```java
@EnableAdminServer
@SpringBootApplication
public class AdminApplication { … }
```

### Q\&A

**Q1: How does Admin discover clients?**
A: Via client registration on startup or via service registry like Eureka.

**Q2: Can Admin perform remote shutdown?**
A: Yes—if `shutdown` endpoint is enabled and secured.

**Q3: How to secure Admin UI?**
A: Use Spring Security, restrict by IP, role-based access.

* RDS instances may be retained—delete manually.
* Ensure snapshots made if needed.
* Clears AWS charges.
* Clean removal of both app and data layers.

### Summary + code

Cleaning up AWS resources involves terminating EB environments and manually deleting associated RDS instances. Always create snapshots if data retention is required. Ensures no lingering costs.

```bash
aws rds delete-db-instance --db-instance-identifier mydb --skip-final-snapshot
```

### Q\&A

**Q1: Does `eb terminate` delete RDS?**
A: No—RDS often needs separate deletion.

**Q2: Can I automate cleanup?**
A: Use CloudFormation or Terraform with lifecycle rules.

**Q3: What if RDS was created inside EB?**
A: Be careful—a snapshot is taken unless you disable it before deleting.
