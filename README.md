## 1. What is Spring?

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* ✅ Enterprise-grade Java framework enabling easier integration, configuration, and extensibility in apps.
* 🚀 Provides modules for IoC/DI, JDBC, MVC, AOP, Security, and more.
* 🧩 Helps build loosely-coupled, testable, maintainable applications.
* 🤖 Powers microservices with Spring Boot support.
* 🔧 Reduces boilerplate via annotations and auto‑configuration.

**Summary**
Spring is a comprehensive Java framework that standardizes enterprise development by offering core services like inversion of control, AOP, security, and MVC. It promotes modularity, configuration flexibility (XML, Java, annotations), and integrates well with databases, messaging, and web services. Spring Boot simplifies setup with embedded servers and convention-over-configuration. It fosters testable, maintainable, production-grade systems suitable for cloud deployment.

```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan("com.example.app")
public class AppConfig { }

@Component
public class HelloService {
    public String sayHello() { return "Hello, Spring!"; }
}

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
        var svc = ctx.getBean(HelloService.class);
        System.out.println(svc.sayHello()); // prints Hello, Spring!
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: Why choose Spring over older frameworks like Struts or plain Servlets?
   **A**: Spring offers holistic support for DI, AOP, transaction management, REST, security, and testability, reducing boilerplate and enhancing modularity.

2. **Q**: What are major Spring modules?
   **A**: Spring Core (IoC/DI), AOP, Spring MVC, Spring Data/JDBC/JPA, Spring Security, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, etc.

3. **Q**: Can you use Spring without Spring Boot?
   **A**: Absolutely—Spring Core works standalone. Boot is optional and just streamlines configuration with embedded web server and starters.

## 2. Jakarta EE vs Spring

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 🔄 Both support dependency injection and web capabilities.
* 🤝 Jakarta EE uses standards (Servlet, CDI, JPA) via containers like Payara/WildFly.
* ⚙️ Spring uses its own contracts and often easier microservice-first stack via Boot.
* 📦 Deployment: Spring Boot produces self‑contained JARs; Jakarta EE runs on external app‑servers.
* 🧪 Testing: Spring Boot has embedded-test support via @SpringBootTest.

**Summary**
Jakarta EE and Spring are industry-leading Java ecosystems. Jakarta EE emphasizes standardized APIs with vendor-neutral containers (EJB, CDI, JAX-RS). Spring offers richer ecosystem, convention-over-configuration approach via Boot, fast startup, and standalone deployments. Use EE for pure-Java-standards consistency across vendors; Spring for flexibility, cloud readiness, and extensive ecosystem. Both can interop—Spring supports JPA, JAX-RS, etc.

```java
// Jakarta EE example: JAX-RS endpoint
@Path("/hello")
@RequestScoped
public class HelloResource {
    @GET @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello() { return "Hello, Jakarta EE!"; }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: When to pick Jakarta EE over Spring?
   **A**: Choose Jakarta EE when you need vendor-neutral portability and strict Java EE standard compliance.

2. **Q**: Can Spring Boot run on an external servlet container?
   **A**: Yes, by packaging as WAR and configuring a Servlet initializer instead of embedding Tomcat/Jetty.

3. **Q**: Does Spring fully support JPA?
   **A**: Yes—Spring Data JPA supports JPA implementations like Hibernate, EclipseLink.

## 3. Introduction to Spring Core

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 💡 Foundation of Spring, providing IoC container, bean lifecycle, DI.
* 📚 Includes ApplicationContext (BeanFactory), resource loading, property support.
* 🔧 Uses @Component, XML, or Java @Bean for bean definitions.
* 👁️‍🗨️ Supports environment abstraction, profiles, and event publishing.
* 🔄 Manages configuration and wiring across layers.

**Summary**
Spring Core is the heart of the framework—its IoC container instantiates, configures, and connects beans via various metadata sources. It offers ApplicationContext interface with lifecycle callbacks, property resolution, resource access, and event system. Beans can be discovered by scanning or declared manually. This abstraction simplifies program architecture by delegating wiring and lifecycle management.

```java
@Configuration
public class CoreConfig {
  @Bean
  public GreetingService greetingService() { return new GreetingServiceImpl(); }
}
public class App {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    var ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(CoreConfig.class);
    System.out.println(ctx.getBean(GreetingService.class).greet());
  }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: What’s the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext?
   **A**: ApplicationContext extends BeanFactory—it eagerly loads singleton beans, supports messages, events, and resource access, not just lazy instantiation.

2. **Q**: How do you define beans?
   **A**: Via XML, Java @Configuration methods with @Bean, or component-scanning using stereotypes (@Component, @Service).

3. **Q**: Can beans be prototype-scoped?
   **A**: Yes. Use `@Scope("prototype")` for multi-instance behavior instead of singleton.

---

## 4. Introduction to IoC & DI

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 🧩 IoC reverses control of object creation to framework.
* 🔌 DI injects dependencies (constructor, setter, field).
* 💻 Simplifies testing—swap implementations easily.
* 🔄 Promotes separation of concerns and loose coupling.
* 💡 Increases modularity and configuration flexibility.

**Summary**
Inversion of Control (IoC) delegates responsibility for managing object lifecycle and dependencies to the Spring container. Dependency Injection (DI) is an implementation of IoC—framework injects collaborators rather than objects manually wiring them. DI improves modularity, testability, and easier configuration. It supports constructor, setter, and field injection.

```java
@Component class A { }
@Component class B {
  private final A a;
  @Autowired
  public B(A a) { this.a = a; }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: Difference between setter and constructor injection?
   **A**: Constructor injection is recommended: makes dependencies required and immutable. Setter injection is optional or circular dependencies.

2. **Q**: Can DI be done without a framework?
   **A**: Yes, manually via new and passing in dependencies. IoC frameworks automate it and scale better.

3. **Q**: When would you use field injection?
   **A**: Rarely—only for test code or highly non‑modular cases. Constructor injection remains preferred.

---

## 5. Demo of IoC & DI

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 👨‍💻 Demonstrates automatic instantiation and injection.
* 🧪 Includes a mock configuration for testing.
* ✅ Shows one-to-many implementation injection.
* 🔁 Wiring via Java config or XML.

**Summary**
In this demo, we define interfaces and implementations wired by Spring. We show constructor injection and switching implementations via profiles or config. This demonstrates loose coupling and easy test swapping. The demo proves DI in action, where class B doesn’t create A but receives it through IoC container wiring.

```java
public interface MessageProvider { String getMessage(); }
@Component @Profile("dev")
public class DevMessageProvider implements MessageProvider { public String getMessage() { return "Dev"; } }
@Component @Profile("prod")
public class ProdMessageProvider implements MessageProvider { public String getMessage() { return "Prod"; } }

@Component class UseMessage {
  private final MessageProvider provider;
  @Autowired
  public UseMessage(MessageProvider provider) { this.provider = provider; }
  public void show() { System.out.println(provider.getMessage()); }
}

public class Demo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.setProperty("spring.profiles.active", "dev");
    var ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext("com.example");
    ctx.getBean(UseMessage.class).show(); // prints "Dev"
  }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: What if multiple beans match DI type?
   **A**: Use @Qualifier or @Primary to resolve ambiguity.

2. **Q**: How to change profile at runtime?
   **A**: Set spring.profiles.active via System property, environment var, or application.properties.

3. **Q**: How to inject a collection of beans?
   **A**: `@Autowired List<MyInterface> allImpls;` injects all matching beans.

---

## 6. Advantages of IoC & DI

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 🔁 Decoupling implementation from usage.
* 🧪 Easier unit testing via mocks.
* 🔄 Easier to swap implementations in deployment.
* 🔍 Centralized wiring and lifecycle management.
* 🌱 Encourages single responsibility and cleaner modules.

**Summary**
IoC and DI improve code quality by decoupling components and externalizing wiring. This boosts modularity, simplifies testing, and allows flexible configuration without code changes. This style aids maintainability, supports evolving requirements, and enables easier refactoring. In large apps, IoC avoids tight coupling and deep dependency chains.

```java
@Service class AService { }
@Service class BService {
  private final AService aService;
  @Autowired BService(AService a) { this.aService = a; }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: How does DI enhance testing?
   **A**: You can inject mocks or stubs instead of real implementations in unit tests.

2. **Q**: What inversion of control containers are besides Spring?
   **A**: Google Guice, Jakarta CDI (Weld/OpenWebBeans), PicoContainer.

3. **Q**: Any disadvantages to DI?
   **A**: Some learning curve, container complexity, potential runtime misconfiguration.

---

## 7. Introductions to Beans, Context, and SpEL

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 🧩 "Bean": managed object in Spring container.
* 🌳 "Context": ApplicationContext gives lifecycle, DI, event, resource APIs.
* 🔤 SpEL: Spring Expression Language used in annotations like `@Value`.
* 🔍 SpEL supports method calls, arithmetic, collection access.
* 🛠️ Leverages SpEL for dynamic configuration and condition evaluation.

**Summary**
Beans are Spring-managed objects declared via XML, Java, or annotations. The ApplicationContext is the central factory for beans, configuration, and eventing. SpEL empowers dynamic expressions such as property access, math, conditional, and calling custom functions. Used in `@Value`, bean definitions, security, and conditional loading.

```java
@Value("#{T(java.lang.Math).random() * 100}")
private double rand;

@Value("#{systemProperties['user.home']}")
private String homeDir;
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: What’s SpEL vs JSP EL or OGNL?
   **A**: SpEL is for Spring metadata config with method execution, arithmetic, indexing—embedded in annotations/XML.

2. **Q**: Can SpEL reference other beans?
   **A**: Yes: `@Value("#{otherBean.someProperty}")`

3. **Q**: What happens on SpEL parse error?
   **A**: Context initialization fails with ExpressionException.

## 8. Introduction to Spring IoC Container

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 🏛️ IoC Container manages bean instantiation, wiring, lifecycle.
* 📦 Bean definitions loaded via ApplicationContext from Java, XML, or classpath.
* 🔁 Supports scopes: singleton, prototype, request, session.
* 🔄 Supports lifecycle callbacks like `@PostConstruct` & `@PreDestroy`.
* 🔍 Also supports Aware interfaces, events, and custom post‑processors.

**Summary**
The Spring IoC Container, represented by BeanFactory/ApplicationContext, is the runtime environment where beans live. It uses metadata to instantiate, configure, and link beans, supports scopes and lifecycle, and adds cross‑cutting services like events. Developers define beans via Java classes, XML, or scan for annotated components. The container handles dependency resolution, lifecycle hooks, and context-wide features.

```java
@Configuration
public class Cfg {
  @Bean(initMethod="init", destroyMethod="cleanup")
  public ResourceHolder rh() { return new ResourceHolder(); }
}
public class Demo {
  var ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(Cfg.class);
  ctx.close(); // triggers destroyMethod
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: How do prototype scoping and container shutdown differ?
   **A**: Prototype beans aren’t tracked by context, so destroy callbacks aren’t called automatically.

2. **Q**: What is BeanPostProcessor?
   **A**: Interface to apply custom logic before/after bean initialization.

3. **Q**: What is BeanFactoryPostProcessor?
   **A**: Modifies bean definitions before container bean instantiation begins.

## 10. Creating Beans inside Spring Context

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 📦 Beans defined through Java @Bean or @Component scanning.
* 🌲 Configuration classes act as bean factories.
* ♻️ You can create beans programmatically using `registrar.registerBean()`.
* 🔁 Beans can be conditionally created via `@Conditional`, `@Profile`.
* 🧪 Useful for dynamic or modular bean registration.

**Summary**
Spring allows bean registration via annotations and XML. Java-based configuration via `@Bean` is concise and type-safe. `@Component` with scanning auto-detects. You can also manually register beans at runtime using `GenericApplicationContext.registerBean()`, enabling dynamic modules or plugin patterns. Conditional annotations help fine-tune when beans exist.

```java
public class DynamicDemo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    var ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();
    ctx.register(DynamicDemo.class);
    ctx.registerBean("foo", String.class, () -> "Dynamically registered");
    ctx.refresh();
    System.out.println(ctx.getBean("foo"));
    ctx.close();
  }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: How to register beans at runtime?
   **A**: Use `registerBean()` on `GenericApplicationContext` before `refresh()`.

2. **Q**: What’s the advantage of Java @Bean over XML?
   **A**: Type safety, easier refactoring, IDE support, and conditional registration via code.

3. **Q**: Can two beans share the same class?
   **A**: Yes—give them different names via `@Bean("name")` or `@Component("...")`.

---

## 🧩 Understanding NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException in Spring

**Use‑case & Highlights**

* Thrown when multiple bean candidates match a required type.
* Occurs with `@Autowired` by type without qualifiers.
* Indicates ambiguous wiring in DI context.
* Fixable by `@Qualifier` or `@Primary`.
* Helps prevent runtime mis-wiring errors.

**Summary**
`NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException` is thrown when DI attempts to inject a type but finds more than one matching bean. It alerts developers to ambiguity in bean configuration. The solution is to mark one bean as `@Primary` or use `@Qualifier` to specify which bean to inject. It's critical for avoiding unexpected runtime behavior in complex contexts with multiple implementations.

```java
@Component class A1 implements Service {}
@Component class A2 implements Service {}

@Component class UseSvc {
  @Autowired @Qualifier("a2") Service svc;
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: How to fix this exception automatically?
   **A**: Use `@Primary` on the default bean implementation.

2. **Q**: Can you specify qualifier at injection point?
   **A**: Yes: `@Qualifier("beanName")`.

3. **Q**: What if using constructor injection?
   **A**: Qualifier goes on constructor parameter: `public C(@Qualifier("x") Service s)`.

---

## 📝 Providing a custom name to the bean

**Use‑case & Highlights**

* Names beans explicitly via `@Component("myBean")` or `@Bean("myBean")`.
* Helps when multiple beans of same type exist.
* Makes XML references and `@Qualifier` simpler.
* Aids readability and maintainability.
* Supports legacy integration with specific bean IDs.

**Summary**
Custom bean naming gives explicit control over Spring-managed instance identification. By default, bean name is derived from class or method. Specifying names is essential when multiple implementations of an interface exist. Named beans support clearer wiring and reduce ambiguity. This practice aids debugging in larger applications.

```java
@Component("fastSvc")
public class FastService implements TaskService {}

@Component("slowSvc")
public class SlowService implements TaskService {}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: What is default bean name for `@Component`?
   **A**: The uncapitalized class name, e.g., `fastService`.

2. **Q**: Can you assign multiple names?
   **A**: Yes: `@Component({"bean1","aliasBean"})`.

3. **Q**: How to inject named bean?
   **A**: Use `@Qualifier("beanName")` along with `@Autowired`.

---

## ⭐ Understanding @Primary Annotation in Spring

**Use‑case & Highlights**

* Marks a bean as default when duplicates exist.
* Eliminates need for `@Qualifier` in many cases.
* Useful in library-provided fallback beans.
* Works with `@Configuration` and `@Component`.
* Can be overridden with explicit qualifiers.

**Summary**
`@Primary` marks a bean as preferred when multiple beans of the same type are candidates. This solves `NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException` without qualifiers. Though convenient, qualifiers should still be used when explicit control is desired. `@Primary` provides safe fallback for most injection scenarios and helps reduce boilerplate.

```java
@Component
@Primary
public class DefaultSvc implements TaskService {}

@Component
public class SpecialSvc implements TaskService {}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: Which wins: `@Primary` or `@Qualifier`?
   **A**: `@Qualifier` always overrides `@Primary`.

2. **Q**: Can you combine them?
   **A**: Yes—primary on one, qualifier to narrow down in edge cases.

3. **Q**: Scope usage?
   **A**: Scoping unaffected—`@Primary` only concerns selection priority.

---

## 🏷️ Creating Beans using @Component Annotation

**Use‑case & Highlights**

* Auto-detected by classpath scanning.
* Frees you from manual `@Bean` definition.
* Stereotypes: `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`.
* Supports default bean naming.
* Encourages modular, decoupled design.

**Summary**
`@Component` and its stereotypes allow Spring to auto-detect and register beans during component scanning. This convention-driven approach reduces annotation clutter and promotes clear intent. Developers annotate classes once and dependencies are injected automatically. Fully supports lifecycle management, AOP, and custom naming. Widely used in modern Spring applications.

```java
@Component
public class GreetingService {
  public String greet() { return "Hi!"; }
}

@Component
public class GreetRunner implements CommandLineRunner {
  @Autowired private GreetingService svc;
  @Override public void run(String... args) { System.out.println(svc.greet()); }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: What's the scan path?
   **A**: Defined via `@ComponentScan(basePackages="com.example")` or by default root package.

2. **Q**: Can you exclude components?
   **A**: Yes—use `excludeFilters` in `@ComponentScan`, or `@Profile`.

3. **Q**: What stereotype for DAOs?
   **A**: Use `@Repository`, which also translates DB exceptions.

---

## 📚 Stereotype Annotations in Spring

**Use‑case & Highlights**

* Classifies roles: `@Controller`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Component`.
* Adds role-specific behavior (e.g. exception translation).
* Improves readability/maintenance.
* Enables automatic scanning and AOP application.
* Semantic clarity in architecture.

**Summary**
Spring’s stereotype annotations provide semantic meaning and enable classpath scanning and AOP features. `@Controller` marks web controllers, `@Service` for business logic, `@Repository` for DAO with exception translation, and `@Component` for generic. These annotations help clearly define responsibilities and allow the container to apply appropriate processing.

```java
@Repository
public class UserRepo {
  public User find(String id) { /* JDBC or JPA logic */ }
}

@Service
public class UserService {
  @Autowired private UserRepo repo;
  public User getUser(String id) { return repo.find(id); }
}

@Controller
public class UserController {
  @Autowired private UserService svc;
  @GetMapping("/user")
  public User get(@RequestParam String id) { return svc.getUser(id); }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: How is `@Repository` special?
   **A**: It triggers Spring’s exception translation for persistence errors.

2. **Q**: What AOP proxies controllers?
   **A**: Spring MVC uses `@Controller` to map HTTP handlers; proxies not applied by default.

3. **Q**: Can service layer have transaction management?
   **A**: Yes—use `@Service` + `@Transactional` to demarcate business transactions.

Here are well-structured deep-dives into each topic, including real-world use-cases, summaries with code snippets, and interview Q\&A.

---

## 1. Comparison between `@Bean` vs `@Component`

### 🔍 Use-case example & explanations

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
  @Bean
  public PaymentService paymentService() {
    return new PaymentServiceImpl();
  }
}

@Component
public class OrderService {
  @Autowired PaymentService paymentService;
}
```

* **@Bean** defined in a `@Configuration` class returns exactly one bean.
* **@Component** auto-detected by classpath scanning.
* `@Bean` allows complex setup logic, conditional creation, runtime parameters.
* `@Component` is simpler and quicker when no configuration logic is needed.
* Both register beans in application context to be autowired.

### 🔚 Summary (≈5 lines)

`@Bean` gives explicit control and flexibility in method-based bean creation, ideal for factory-style logic. `@Component` offers auto-detection with less boilerplate. Use `@Bean` for third-party classes or custom instantiation logic; use `@Component` for clean, self-contained business classes. Both integrate into Spring DI container.

```java
@Bean PaymentService paymentService() { return new PaymentServiceImpl(); }
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A

**1. What's the difference between @Bean and @Component?**
@Bean is method-level, used inside @Configuration, while @Component is class-level and scanned by classpath.

**2. When would you choose @Bean over @Component?**
When instantiating third-party types or needing complex init logic.

**3. Can both inject dependencies?**
Yes—both register as beans and support @Autowired, @Qualifier, etc.

## 2. Understanding `@PostConstruct` Annotation

### 🔍 Use-case example & explanations

```java
@Component
public class CacheLoader {
  private Map<String,String> cache = new HashMap<>();
  @Autowired FileService fileService;

  @PostConstruct
  public void init() {
    cache = fileService.loadAll();
  }
}
```

* Runs after bean instantiation, dependency injection complete.
* Ideal for initialising resources or caches.
* Eliminates the need for `InitializingBean` interface.
* Supports exception handling—fails context start on error.
* Executes before bean is available for use by other beans.

### 🔚 Summary

`@PostConstruct` marks an initialization method called once dependencies are injected but before any business logic runs. It simplifies setup routines like cache loading or DB connection pooling without implementing lifecycle interfaces. Execution occurs before bean is available to clients.

```java
@PostConstruct void init() { cache = fileService.loadAll(); }
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A

**1. When is @PostConstruct invoked?**
After injection and before bean is ready for use.

**2. What if init method throws an exception?**
Bean fails to initialize, blocking context startup.

**3. Alternatives to @PostConstruct?**
Implement `InitializingBean.afterPropertiesSet()` or specify `init-method` in XML.

---

## 3. Understanding `@PreDestroy` Annotation

### 🔍 Use-case example & explanations

```java
@Component
public class TemporaryFileCleaner {
  private Path tempDir = Paths.get("/tmp/app");

  @PreDestroy
  public void cleanup() throws IOException {
    Files.walk(tempDir).forEach(Files::delete);
  }
}
```

* Called before bean removal and context shutdown.
* Useful for releasing resources: closing files, sockets, cleanup.
* Less boilerplate than `DisposableBean`.
* Works even if shutdown commanded programmatically or by container.
* Ensures safe termination logic runs.

### 🔚 Summary

`@PreDestroy` marks a cleanup method that runs before bean destruction, ideal for freeing resources, deleting temporary files, closing DB/sockets. It simplifies DI-managed lifecycle without implementing Spring interfaces.

```java
@PreDestroy void cleanup() throws IOException { … }
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A

**1. When does @PreDestroy execute?**
Before bean destruction during context shutdown.

**2. What if cleanup method fails?**
Exception logs; shutdown continues—but application context may warn.

**3. Alternatives to @PreDestroy?**
Use `DisposableBean.destroy()` or XML `destroy-method`.

---

## 4. Creating Beans Programmatically using `registerBean()`

### 🔍 Use-case example & explanations

```java
AnnotationConfigApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();
ctx.registerBean(UserService.class, () -> new UserService("admin"));
ctx.refresh();

UserService us = ctx.getBean(UserService.class);
```

* Creates bean on the fly at runtime.
* Useful for dynamic bean creation based on runtime configs.
* Skips classpath scanning, manual registration.
* λ-provided factory allows constructor args injection.
* Great in programmatic bootstrapping or plugin architectures.

### 🔚 Summary

`registerBean()` enables runtime registration of beans with optional supplier logic and constructor args, bypassing static configuration. It's ideal for dynamic needs like user-customized components or plugin-based modules.

```java
ctx.registerBean(UserService.class, () -> new UserService("admin"));
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A

**1. When use registerBean() vs annotations?**
When bean configuration must happen dynamically.

**2. Does registerBean support scopes?**
Yes, overloads allow scope and qualifier settings.

**3. Can it wire dependencies?**
Yes, supplier can `ctx.getBean(...)` inside.

---

## 5. Creating Beans using XML Configurations

### 🔍 Use-case example & explanations

```xml
<beans>
  <bean id="emailService" class="com.example.EmailService">
    <property name="host" value="smtp.example.com"/>
  </bean>
  <bean id="userNotifier" class="com.example.UserNotifier">
    <constructor-arg ref="emailService"/>
  </bean>
</beans>
```

* Old-school but still valid, especially for legacy projects.
* Explicit property & constructor injection.
* Clear separation from code, editable by ops teams.
* Allows profile-specific XML includes.
* Supports `import`, `alias`, `depends-on`, property placeholders.

### 🔚 Summary

XML bean definitions remain useful in legacy or ops-managed environments. They allow externalized, non-compiled configuration of beans, injection values, and wiring with `<bean>` and `<property>` elements.

```xml
<bean id="emailService" class="…"/>
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A

**1. Advantages of XML config?**
Language-agnostic, editable without recompilation.

**2. Can XML & annotations coexist?**
Yes—Spring merges both.

**3. How to enable bean profiling?**
Use `context:property-placeholder`, `<import resource="...-${profile}.xml"/>`.

---

## 6. Why Should We Use Frameworks?

### 🔍 Use-case example & explanations

* Avoid reinventing DI, AOP, MVC, transaction management.
* Increase developer productivity and consistency.
* Enforce design patterns and separation of concerns.
* Provide cross-cutting solutions like logging and caching.
* Standardize integration with third-party systems.

### 🔚 Summary

Frameworks like Spring abstract common boilerplate (DI, transactions, web MVC, AOP), speeding development, enforcing consistency, and enabling easier maintenance. They handle cross-cutting concerns, adapt to enterprise needs, and reduce bugs. Frameworks are the backbone of scalable, maintainable systems.

```java
@Service public class ReportService { … }
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A

**1. What’s a framework?**
A reusable software platform that standardizes common patterns and functionalities.

**2. Why use Spring over manual coding?**
Reduces boilerplate, improves testing, promotes modularity, integrates advanced features.

**3. Risks of frameworks?**
Potential overuse, complexity, learning curve—must ensure real benefit.

     *Answer: b.*

---

## 10. Wiring Beans using `@Autowiring`

### 🔍 Use-case example & explanations

```java
@Service
public class InvoiceService {
  private final TaxCalculator taxCalculator;

  @Autowired
  public InvoiceService(TaxCalculator taxCalculator) {
    this.taxCalculator = taxCalculator;
  }
}
```

* Constructor injection preferred for immutability and testability.
* `@Autowired` can be used on constructor, setter, field.
* Supports optional injection (`required=false`).
* Use `@Qualifier` when multiple candidates.
* If there’s only one bean of type, `@Autowired` infers automatically.

### 🔚 Summary

`@Autowired` enables Spring to inject dependencies automatically. Constructor injection promotes immutability; setter/field injection offers flexibility. Use qualifiers for ambiguity, and optional flags for conditional wiring. DI enhances decoupling and testability.

```java
@Autowired public InvoiceService(TaxCalculator tc) { … }
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A

**1. Why prefer constructor injection?**
Makes dependencies explicit and the bean immutable.

**2. How to handle multiple beans of same type?**
Use `@Qualifier("beanName")`.

**3. What if a dependency is missing?**
Spring throws a `NoSuchBeanDefinitionException`.

---

## 11. Introduction to Wiring & Autowiring inside Spring

### 🔍 Use-case example & explanations

* **Manual wiring**: use `@Bean` or XML `<bean ref="..."/>`.
* **Annotation-based**: `@Component`, `@Autowired`, `@Qualifier`.
* **Java config**: central `@Configuration` + `@Bean` orchestration.
* **ByType vs ByName**: field-type matching vs named-bean injection.
* **Advanced**: `@Primary`, `@Resource`, `@Inject` support.

### 🔚 Summary

Spring wiring links bean dependencies within the container. It can be manual, annotation-based, or programmatic. `@Autowired` handles by-type, `@Qualifier` by-name. Java-config and XML offer explicit control; annotations streamline typical use. Proper wiring ensures robust, maintainable systems.

```java
@Autowired InvoiceService invoiceService;
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A

**1. Difference between byType and byName?**
ByType matches bean types; byName uses bean id or qualifier.

**2. What is @Primary used for?**
Defines default bean when multiple candidates exist.

**3. Can you combine XML and annotation wiring?**
Yes—Spring merges both configuration mechanisms.

---

Here are detailed breakdowns, each with a real-world coding example, bullet-point explanations, a summary with code, and 3 interview Q\&A. Let's go!

---

## 1. **Comparison between `@Bean` vs `@Component`**

### ✅ Use-case & Example:

Imagine you have a third-party `EmailService` you can’t modify but need as a Spring bean.

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
  @Bean
  public EmailService emailService() {
    return new EmailService("smtp.example.com");
  }
}

@Component
public class NotificationManager {
  private final EmailService emailService;

  public NotificationManager(EmailService emailService) {
    this.emailService = emailService;
  }

  public void send(String msg) {
    emailService.send(msg);
  }
}
```

### 🌟 Explanations:

* `@Component` applies classpath scanning; auto-detects, and auto-instantiates.
* `@Bean` is for manual bean creation in `@Configuration` classes.
* Use `@Bean` when you need customization or can’t modify the class.
* `@Component` is concise and great for your own classes.
* Both get registered in the Spring context and support DI and lifecycle callbacks.

### 📝 Summary (5 lines):

1. Use `@Component` for your own class auto-scanning.
2. Use `@Bean` for third-party/custom instantiation logic.
3. Both register beans and support injection.
4. `@Bean` sits in `@Configuration` and allows parameter/config overrides.
5. `@Component` is annotation-driven—less plumbing, more automatic.

```java
// summary code snippet:
@Configuration
class Config {
  @Bean EmailService es() { return new EmailService("host"); }
}
@Component
class C { C(EmailService es){} }
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q**: Can both be used together?
   **A**: Yes. `@Bean` for custom wiring, `@Component` for scanning your own classes.
2. **Q**: Why might you choose `@Bean` over `@Component`?
   **A**: You need control over instantiation, constructor args, or third-party objects.
3. **Q**: Does `@Component` allow constructor args?
   **A**: Yes, via DI—Spring resolves dependencies automatically.

---

## 2. **Understanding `@PostConstruct`**

### ✅ Use-case & Example:

You need to setup a file reader after bean creation.

```java
@Component
public class CsvLoader {
  private BufferedReader reader;
  private final String path = "/data/users.csv";

  @PostConstruct
  public void init() throws IOException {
    reader = Files.newBufferedReader(Paths.get(path));
  }
}
```

### 🌟 Explanations:

* Executes after DI and before bean is ready to be used.
* Useful for resource initialization, e.g., DB connections, file loading.
* Must be `public void noArgs`, and run once.
* Managed by container: works for `@Component`, `@Bean`, etc.
* Fails startup if exception thrown—good for early failure detection.

### 📝 Summary (5 lines):

1. Runs after bean instantiation + DI.
2. Ideal for initialization tasks (DB, file, etc.).
3. Annotated methods are auto-discovered and executed.
4. Can throw exceptions—fail fast.
5. Integrates with Spring lifecycle seamlessly.

```java
@PostConstruct
public void init() { /* setup here */ }
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A:

   **A**: `@PostConstruct` is annotation-based, not tied to Spring interface.
2. **Q**: Can @PostConstruct be private?
   **A**: No—must be `public void noArgs`.
3. **Q**: What happens if the method throws an exception?
   **A**: Spring context fails to start (startup error).

---

## 3. **Understanding `@PreDestroy`**

### ✅ Use-case & Example:

Closing resources like sockets or file streams gracefully.

```java
@Component
public class CacheManager {
  private final DataSource ds;

  public CacheManager(DataSource ds) {
    this.ds = ds;
  }

  @PreDestroy
  public void cleanup() throws SQLException {
    ds.getConnection().close();
  }
}
```

### 🌟 Explanations:

* Called before bean is removed/shutdown.
* Perfect for releasing resources, closing connections.
* Must be `public void noArgs` and executes once.
* Only works if Spring context is shutdown orderly (not killed).
* Helps avoid memory leaks and resource locks.

### 📝 Summary (5 lines):

1. Called on container shutdown for cleanup tasks.
2. Use for file handles, connections, threads, etc.
3. Annotated on `public void noArgs` method.
4. Executes during graceful shutdown.
5. Helps ensure resource integrity and no leaks.

```java
@PreDestroy
public void cleanup() { /* release resources here */ }
```

### 🎤 Interview Q\&A:

1. **Q**: Can resource cleanup occur without `@PreDestroy`?
   **A**: Yes—but less declaratively. Could rely on `shutdownHook`.
2. **Q**: Can you rely on `@PreDestroy` during JVM kill?
   **A**: No—it won’t execute on abrupt kills.
3. **Q**: Multiple `@PreDestroy` methods?
   **A**: Allowed, execution order unspecified—prefer single method.

---

## 4. **Creating Beans programmatically using `registerBean()`**

### ✅ Use-case & Example:

    SpringApplication.run(DynamicApp.class, args);
  }

  @Override
  public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext ac) {
    this.ctx = (GenericApplicationContext) ac;
    ctx.registerBean(
      "dynamicService", DynamicService.class,
      () -> new DynamicService("runtime-param")
    );
  }
}

class DynamicService {
  public DynamicService(String param) { /* ... */ }
}
```

### 🌟 Explanations:

* Useful when bean creation depends on runtime data.
* Avoids static config—flexible injection based on logic.
* Takes name, class, and `Supplier` callback.

  }
}
```

### 🌟 Explanations:

* `@ComponentScan` picks up classes annotated with `@Component`.
* `@Bean` can depend on other beans via method parameters.
* `@Autowired` resolves dependencies into classes.
* Wiring = connecting beans; auto-wiring is automatic DI.
* Works through setter, constructor, field.

### 📝 Summary (5 lines):

1. `@ComponentScan` discovers annotated beans.
2. `@Bean` allows explicit, controlled wiring.
3. Method parameters of `@Bean` are auto-injected.
4. `@Autowired` populates dependencies in components.
5. Together they form Spring's wiring / auto-wiring mechanism.

2. **Q**: How does Spring find beans?
   **A**: Via classpath scanning, `@Bean`, XML, or programmatic registration.
3. **Q**: Can auto-wiring pick ambiguous types?
   **A**: Only if resolved by qualifier or bean name.

---

Here’s a structured breakdown of key Spring dependency‑injection techniques, circular‑dependency theory and resolution, interview‑style questions, plus a sample assignment.

---

## 1. Wiring Beans using method‑call (i.e. manual call in configuration)

**Use‑case**: simple JavaConfig with explicit bean creation via calling factory methods.

* You define beans in a `@Configuration` class; one bean method calls another method to obtain a dependency.
* Spring treats each bean method as a singleton unless otherwise scoped.
* Enables full control but more verbose than annotation‐driven wiring.
* Useful when migrating legacy code from XML.
* Dependency is explicit and static.

**Summary**: JavaConfig method‑call wiring lets one `@Bean` method invoke another to inject dependencies, providing explicit wiring without annotations. It’s verbose but clear.
**Code**:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
  @Bean
  public ServiceA serviceA() {
    return new ServiceA(serviceB());
  }
  @Bean
  public ServiceB serviceB() {
    return new ServiceB();
  }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: What happens if you call `serviceB()` twice in config?
   **A**: Spring returns same singleton instance (CGLIB proxies bean methods), so no duplication.
2. **Q**: When would you use method‑call wiring?
   **A**: In legacy migration, explicit wiring, or for beans where annotation scanning isn’t feasible.
3. **Q**: Is order of methods relevant?
   **A**: Not strictly—Spring resolves dependencies and creates target beans before calling.

---

## 2. Wiring Beans using method‑parameters (JavaConfig)

**Use‑case**: cleaner JavaConfig where Spring injects parameters rather than manual calls.

* In `@Configuration`, define a `@Bean` method with parameters of other beans.
* Spring resolves parameters by type and invokes methods in correct order.
* Cleaner than method‑call wiring.
* Maintains singleton scope.
* Dependencies easily testable.

**Summary**: Method‑parameter wiring uses JavaConfig bean method parameters to inject dependencies automatically; it’s clean and declarative.
**Code**:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
  @Bean ServiceB serviceB() { return new ServiceB(); }
  @Bean ServiceA serviceA(ServiceB b) { return new ServiceA(b); }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: Is parameter naming important?
   **A**: Spring matches by type; names matter only if ambiguity exists.
2. **Q**: How does this differ from constructor injection in components?
   **A**: It’s at config time; components still need annotations.
3. **Q**: Can you inject prototype scoped beans via method‑parameters?
   **A**: Yes, but method method returns are singleton; use lookup otherwise.

---

## 3. Wiring Beans using @Autowired on class fields

**Use‑case**: quick injection without constructor or setter boilerplate.

* Annotate private fields with `@Autowired`.
* Spring uses reflection to inject dependencies.
* Simplest syntax but hides dependencies.
* Makes unit testing and immutability harder ([Java Tech Blog][1], [CodingEasyPeasy][2], [Reddit][3]).
* Can help resolve circular dependencies if other styles fail ([CodingEasyPeasy][2]).

**Summary**: Field injection is terse but conceals class dependencies, harms testability, and is generally discouraged in favor of constructor-based injection.
**Code**:

```java
@Component
public class Car {
  @Autowired private Engine engine;
  public void drive() { engine.start(); }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: Why is field injection discouraged?
   **A**: Dependencies aren’t explicit; hard to test; breaks immutability ([Reddit][4]).
2. **Q**: Can you inject optional dependencies via field injection?
   **A**: Yes via `@Autowired(required=false)` but requires null checks.
3. **Q**: Does Spring use setter injection if no setter exists?
   **A**: For field injection Spring still injects by reflection; setter injection not used.

---

## 4. Wiring Beans using @Autowired on setter method

**Use‑case**: optional or mutable dependencies, or those requiring post‑initialization handling.

* Use setter methods with `@Autowired`.
* Spring calls constructor first, then injects dependencies via setter.
* Allows null-checks and dynamic changes at runtime.
* Often used to break circular dependencies ([Baeldung][5], [GeeksforGeeks][6]).
* Slightly less recommended than constructor injection for mandatory dependencies.

**Summary**: Setter injection places dependencies after bean instantiation, allowing mutability and optional wiring; it's useful for circular dependency resolution.
**Code**:

```java
@Component
public class ServiceA {
  private ServiceB b;
  @Autowired
  public void setServiceB(ServiceB b) { this.b = b; }
  public void doA() { b.doB(); }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: When would setter injection be preferable to constructor injection?
   **A**: For optional dependencies, or to break circular dependencies.
2. **Q**: What is a downside?
   **A**: Bean is mutable; possible null-pointer use if setter not called.
3. **Q**: How does Spring detect setter injection?
   **A**: The presence of `@Autowired` on a setter informs Spring to inject.

---

\## 5. Wiring Beans using @Autowired on constructor
**Use‑case**: recommended style for mandatory dependencies, immutability, and clarity.

* Annotate constructor (or omit if single constructor since Spring 4.3).
* Dependencies are final, explicit, and required.
* Supports testability and immutability.
* Prevents circular dependencies at compile-time.
* Preferred by Spring docs and community ([Reddit][7], [Reddit][3], [Reddit][8]).

**Summary**: Constructor injection is the preferred Spring wiring method: explicit, immutable, testable, and safe from runtime surprises.
**Code**:

```java
@Component
public class Engine { /*...*/ }
@Component
public class Car {
  private final Engine engine;
  @Autowired
  public Car(Engine engine) { this.engine = engine; }
  public void drive() { engine.start(); }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: Do you need `@Autowired` if only one constructor is defined?
   **A**: No—Spring auto-wires a single constructor since 4.3 .
2. **Q**: Can constructor injection contribute to circular dependency?
   **A**: Yes—it makes cycles impossible at runtime, triggering immediate error.
3. **Q**: How does constructor injection aid unit testing?
   **A**: You can instantiate class directly with mocks without Spring.

---

## 6. Deep dive of Autowiring inside Spring – Theory

* Autowiring resolves bean dependencies by type (default), possibly by name.
* Modes include `no`, `byName`, `byType`, `constructor` in XML.
* Annotation-based: `@Autowired` supports by type; ambiguous beans need `@Primary` or `@Qualifier` ([Java Tech Blog][1], [Home][9], [Home][10]).
* Simple scalar properties are not autowirable.
* Constructor > setter > field in priority and practice.
* Autowiring is overridden by explicit configuration.

**Summary**: Spring autowiring simplifies bean resolution by type/name but has pitfalls such as ambiguity, hidden dependencies, and limitations on simple types. Use qualifiers or explicit wiring when needed.
**Code**: N/A (theoretical).

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: Why can’t you autowire `String` properties?
   **A**: Spring doesn't resolve simple/primitive or String types via autowiring.
2. **Q**: How do you resolve multiple candidates?
   **A**: Use `@Qualifier` or mark one bean `@Primary`.
3. **Q**: Does XML autowiring support field injection?
   **A**: No—XML supports only constructor or setter.

---

## 7. Deep dive of Autowiring inside Spring – Coding example

**Use‑case**: demonstrating field/setter/constructor with qualifiers and how Spring picks.

* Define two beans implementing same interface.
* Autowire by type → ambiguity → qualifier.
* Show constructor vs setter vs field.

**Summary**: Example demonstrates autowiring behavior, ambiguity resolution via `@Qualifier` or `@Primary`, and differences in injection methods.

**Code**:

```java
@Component interface Engine {}
@Component @Primary class V8Engine implements Engine {}
@Component @Qualifier("v6") class V6Engine implements Engine {}
@Component class Car {
  private final Engine engine;
  @Autowired
  public Car(Engine engine) { this.engine = engine; }
}
```

---

## 8. Understanding and Avoiding Circular dependencies

**Theory & practice**:

* Circular dependency occurs when A depends on B and B depends back on A—Spring throws `BeanCurrentlyInCreationException` for constructors ([Java Code Geeks][11], [Home][10], [Reddit][12], [smartprogramming.in][13], [GeeksforGeeks][6]).
* Setter or field injection can sometimes resolve cycles .
* Use `@Lazy` to defer creation and break the cycle ([Baeldung][5]).
* Better: redesign to remove the cycle via interfaces or service refactoring.
* Other tools: `@PostConstruct`, `ApplicationContextAware` to wire manually ([Baeldung][5]).

**Summary**: Spring circular dependencies must be avoided. Constructor injection fails; setter/field injection or `@Lazy` can break the cycle. Best solution: refactor design.

**Code**:

```java
@Component class A {
  private B b;
  @Autowired public void setB(@Lazy B b) { this.b = b; }
}
@Component class B {
  private A a;
  @Autowired public void setA(@Lazy A a) { this.a = a; }
}
```

## 9. Problem Statement for Assignment

**Problem**: Create a small Spring Boot app with three services (`ServiceX`, `ServiceY`, `ServiceZ`) where `ServiceX` depends on `Y` and `Z`, `Y` depends on `Z`, and `Z` on `X`. Demonstrate detection and resolution of circular dependencies using different wiring styles, qualifiers, bean scopes, and lazy injection.

---

## 10. Solution for Assignment

**Outline**:

* Show failure with constructor injection causing `BeanCurrentlyInCreationException`.
* Resolve using setter injection + `@Lazy` on one dependency.
* Use `@Qualifier` if multiple bean candidates.
* Demonstrate prototype bean injected into singleton via `@Lookup`.
* Provide unit tests.

---

## 11. “Wiring Beans using @Autowiring” Quiz

1. Which type of injection makes dependencies immutable?

   * A: Constructor injection
2. How to resolve ambiguity with two beans of same type?

   * A: `@Qualifier` or `@Primary`
3. Can you autowire String property?

   * A: No

---

## 12. Beans scope inside Spring framework

* **Singleton**: Default; one instance per Spring context.
* **Prototype**: New instance each time requested.
* **Request**, **Session**, **Application**, **Websocket**: web-aware scopes.
* Injector into singleton from prototype leads to single prototype reused unless you use `@Lookup` or ObjectFactory/Provider.
* Use prototype for stateful, singleton for stateless services ([Baeldung][5], [Java Tech Blog][1], [Reddit][7], [Reddit][14]).

---

Sure! Let’s dive into each topic with real-time use cases, coding examples, explanations, summary, and interview Q\&As. Given the volume, I’ll cover each concisely but comprehensively.

---

## 1. Introduction to Bean Scopes inside Spring 😊

**Use‑case**: Choosing bean lifetimes in web apps:

* **Singleton**: one instance – e.g. `UserService`.
* **Prototype**: new per request – e.g. stateful `ReportGenerator`.
* **Request**: one per HTTP request.
* **Session**: one per HTTP session.
* **Application**: one per ServletContext.

**5 bullet point explanations**:

* Spring supports 5 built-in bean scopes.
* Default is **singleton**.
* Prototype beans: new on each `getBean()`.
* Web-aware scopes (`request`, `session`, `application`) require `WebApplicationContext`.
* Proper scope reduces memory/faults in concurrent scenarios.

**5-line summary**
In Spring, bean scopes define lifecycle and visibility. Singleton beans are created once per IoC container. Prototype beans yield a new instance upon each injection request. Web scopes (request, session, application) tie bean life to HTTP lifecycle. Choosing the right scope prevents state issues and improves application performance.

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
  @Bean @Scope("singleton") public UserService userService(){ return new UserService(); }
  @Bean @Scope("prototype") public ReportGenerator reportGenerator(){ return new ReportGenerator(); }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. *Q: What’s the default bean scope?*
   *A: Singleton—one instance per container.*
2. *Q: When would you use prototype scope?*
   *A: For stateful beans needing fresh instances per use.*
3. *Q: Difference between session and request scopes?*
   *A: Request lives for one HTTP request; session lasts the user’s session.*

---

## 2. Deep‑dive on Singleton Bean scope

**Use‑case**: Shared stateless services like `EmailSender`.

**5 bullet points**:

* **Lazy/Eager**: instantiated at container startup or on first use.
* Stateless✔️ – concurrency safe by design.
* Shared across threads – avoid mutable state.
* Memory efficient – single instance.
* Beware with non-thread‑safe resources.

**5‑line summary**
Singleton is the default scope in Spring. It ensures a single shared instance per container. Ideal for stateless service beans. Can be eagerly or lazily loaded. Must avoid mutable shared state to prevent threading issues.

```java
@Component
public class EmailService {
  public void send(String to, String msg){ /*send mail*/ }
}
```

**Q\&A**:

1. *Q: When is a singleton bean created?*
   *A: By default on container startup unless marked lazy.*
2. *Q: Are singleton beans thread‑safe?*
   *A: They must be stateless or handle concurrency manually.*
3. *Q: How to enforce thread-safety in singleton?*
   *A: Use immutable fields, local variables, or synchronization.*

---

## 3. What is a Race Condition

**Use‑case**: Two threads updating a shared counter simultaneously → corrupted result.

**5 bullet points**:

* Occurs when threads share mutable state without synchronization.
* Timing-dependent – non-deterministic bugs.
* Common in multithreading scenarios.
* Prevent with locks, `synchronized`, or atomic types.
* Hard to reproduce.

**5‑line summary**
A race condition occurs when two threads access and modify shared data simultaneously without proper synchronization, leading to unpredictable results. It's timing-dependent and non-deterministic. The usual counterexample is incrementing a shared variable. Solutions include `synchronized`, `Lock`, `AtomicInteger`, or avoiding shared mutable state.

```java
@Service
public class CounterService {
  private int counter = 0;
  public void increment(){ counter++; }
  public int get() { return counter; }
}
```

**Q\&A**:

1. *Q: How to fix race conditions in Java?*
   *A: Use `synchronized`, `Lock`, `AtomicInteger`, etc.*
2. *Q: Differences between `synchronized` and `Lock`?*
   *A: `Lock` supports try-lock, fairness, manual unlocking.*
3. *Q: What’s atomic class?*
   *A: Thread‑safe classes like `AtomicInteger` using CAS.*

---

## 4. Use cases of Singleton Bean scope

**Use‑case**: Logging, caching, service facades.

**5 bullet points**:

* Caching beans to hold common data.
* Service facades stateless across requests.
* Utility classes e.g. `EmailService`, `JwtTokenUtil`.
* Shared resources like `ObjectMapper`.
* Singleton DB access pools, if thread-safe.

**5‑line summary**
Singleton beans are excellent for stateless services, caching, shared utility instances, and resource pools. They minimize memory footprint and initialization cost. They must avoid shared mutable state. They can be eagerly or lazily loaded based on startup needs.

```java
@Component
public class CacheService {
  private Map<String,String> cache = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
  public String get(String key){ return cache.get(key); }
}
```

**Q\&A**:

1. *Q: Why prefer singleton for caching?*
   *A: Data shared across the app, faster access, lower overhead.*
2. *Q: Can singleton hold user-specific state?*
   *A: No—must remain stateless or risk data leakage.*
3. *Q: How to configure a bean as singleton?*
   *A: Default; explicitly using `@Scope("singleton")`.*

---

## 5. Deep‑dive of Eager and Lazy instantiation of Singleton scope

**Use‑case**: Large startup time vs memory usage tradeoffs.

**5 bullet points**:

* Eager: created at container init.
* Lazy: created on first request.
* `@Lazy`: annotation on bean or config class.
* Spring Boot supports lazy initialization globally.
* Affects startup time, memory usage.

**5‑line summary**
Spring singletons can be eagerly or lazily instantiated. Eager beans initialize at container startup; lazy ones only when first needed. Lazy saves startup time and memory but delays failure detection. Both support `@Lazy` or global config via `spring.main.lazy-initialization=true`.

```java
@Configuration
public class Config {
  @Bean @Lazy
  public HeavyService heavyService(){ return new HeavyService(); }
}
```

**Q\&A**:

1. *Q: Pros of eager vs lazy?*
   *A: Eager fails early; lazy saves startup time.*
2. *Q: How to enable lazy globally in Spring Boot?*
   *A: `spring.main.lazy-initialization=true`.*
3. *Q: Can you mix lazy and eager?*
   *A: Yes—annotate individual beans with `@Lazy` or omit for eager.*

---

Great! Let’s continue in the same format for the remaining topics:

---

## 6. Demo of Eager and Lazy Instantiation of Singleton Bean

**Use‑case**: Logging startup behavior differences.

**5 bullet points**:

* Use `@Lazy` on a `@Component` to delay its creation.
* Log in constructors to observe instantiation timing.
* Access bean in `main()` to trigger lazy init.
* Without access, lazy bean never gets created.
* Useful to verify configuration.

**5-line summary**
Implement two beans—one eager (default) and one marked with `@Lazy`. Use log statements in their constructors to inspect when they’re loaded. Running the application without accessing the lazy bean shows only the eager one initializes. Accessing it later triggers its creation. This demo helps illustrate the instantiation mechanism clearly.

```java
@Component public class EagerBean {
  public EagerBean() { System.out.println("EagerBean created"); }
}

@Component @Lazy public class LazyBean {
  public LazyBean() { System.out.println("LazyBean created"); }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
  AnnotationConfigApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
  System.out.println("Context initialized");
  ctx.getBean(LazyBean.class);  // triggers lazy creation
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: What happens if you never request a lazy bean?
   **A**: It never gets instantiated.
2. **Q**: How to verify when beans are created?
   **A**: Log or debug in bean constructor or `@PostConstruct`.
3. **Q**: Can `@Lazy` apply to prototypes?
   **A**: Yes, but prototype is always lazy by nature.

---

## 7. Eager Initialization vs Lazy Initialization

**Use‑case**: Tuning startup time and resource usage.

**5 bullet points**:

* Eager: startup time includes all beans instantiation.
* Lazy: spreads cost; some beans may never be instantiated.
* Eager helps discover config errors early.
* Lazy saves memory for unused beans.
* Trade-off depends on application scale and critical components.

**5-line summary**
Eager initialization builds all singleton beans at startup, ensuring immediate availability and early failure detection, but increases startup time. Lazy initialization defers bean creation until needed, improving startup latency and memory usage but might delay failures and runtime performance. Choose strategy based on deployment speed vs. run-time reliability trade-offs.

```java
spring.main.lazy-initialization=true  // in application.properties
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Which cases prefer eager init?
   **A**: When most beans are always needed and early validation matters.
2. **Q**: Trade-offs of lazy init?
   **A**: Faster startup vs. delayed failure detection.
3. **Q**: How to apply lazy init to single bean?
   **A**: Annotate with `@Lazy`, either on class or injection point.

---

## 8. Deep‑dive of Prototype Bean Scope

**Use‑case**: `ReportGenerator` needing fresh state per use.

**5 bullet points**:

* Prototype beans produce new instance per `getBean()`.
* Spring doesn’t manage full lifecycle beyond creation.
* No de‑allocation hooks—`destroy()` not auto-called.
* Can inject prototype into singleton via `@Lookup`.
* Useful for stateful or resource-intensive beans.

**5-line summary**
Prototype scope gives a fresh bean instance on each call to `getBean()`. Spring initializes it but doesn’t manage complete lifecycle. Destruction logic must be handled manually. Useful for stateful, short-lived components, like per-request form handlers or document generators. For use inside singletons, use lookup methods or `ObjectProvider`.

```java
@Component @Scope("prototype")
public class ReportGenerator {
  private int vol = new Random().nextInt();
  public int getVol() { return vol; }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: When is prototype bean destroyed?
   **A**: Never automatically—bean user must handle cleanup.
2. **Q**: How to inject prototype into singleton?
   **A**: Use `@Lookup`, `ObjectFactory`, or `ApplicationContext.getBean(...)`.
3. **Q**: Why not use prototype for all?
   **A**: More overhead and no lifecycle management; potentially high memory usage.

---

## 9. Singleton Beans vs Prototype Beans

**Use‑case**: Comparing shared vs transient bean behavior.

**5 bullet points**:

* Singleton: one shared instance, prototype: new per request.
* Singleton suitable for stateless, thread-safe beans.
* Prototype used for stateful, non-shared data models.
* Lifecycle fully managed only for singleton.
* Injection differs—prototype needs lookup to enforce new instance.

**5-line summary**
Singleton beans are shared singletons with full lifecycle management and are default. Prototype beans create new instances each injection call but lack lifecycle callbacks beyond initialization. Choose singleton for shared, stateless services; choose prototype for stateful per-use components. Prototype injection into singleton requires special handling.

```java
@Component public class Client {
  @Autowired ApplicationContext ctx;
  public void run() {
    ReportGenerator r1 = ctx.getBean(ReportGenerator.class);
    ReportGenerator r2 = ctx.getBean(ReportGenerator.class);
    assert r1 != r2;
  }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Can prototype bean be injected into singleton directly?
   **A**: Yes, but one instance on context creation—use `@Lookup` or `Provider`.
2. **Q**: Which scope is default?
   **A**: Singleton.
3. **Q**: Prototype lifecycle callbacks?
   **A**: Only `@PostConstruct` runs; no `@PreDestroy`.

## 10. "Beans scope inside Spring framework" Quiz

**5 bullet points**:

* Quiz tests knowledge of 5 core scopes.
* Include scenario-based questions.
* Provide answers and explanations.
* Reinforces distinctions between singleton and prototype.
* Clarifies web-specific scopes.

**5-line summary**
A quiz ensures understanding of Spring’s bean scopes: singleton, prototype, request, session, application. It helps reinforce correct usage by asking scenario-based questions—like choosing a scope for per-user session data—and ensuring clear rationale for each answer. Answers include concise justifications.

```text
1. Default scope? – Singleton (shared).  
2. Scope for each HTTP request? – Request  
3. New on each injection? – Prototype  
... etc.
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Which scope binds to ServletContext?
   **A**: Application.
2. **Q**: Scope for user login data?
   **A**: Session.
3. **Q**: Prototype vs. Request difference?
   **A**: Prototype-from container always; request tied to HTTP layer.

---

## 11. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) inside Spring framework

**Use‑case**: Logging, transaction management, security checks.

**5 bullet points**:

* Cross-cutting concerns separated from business code.
* Uses proxies: JDK/CGlib.
* Key terms: advice, pointcut, aspect, join point, weaving.
* Supports before/after/around/etc advices.
* Configured via `@Aspect` and `@EnableAspectJAutoProxy`.

**5-line summary**
Spring AOP modularizes cross-cutting concerns like logging, transactions, and security. Aspects contain advices defining behavior at join points matched by pointcuts. Spring uses dynamic proxies or CGlib to weave aspects at runtime. Configuration is simplified through annotations and XML. This improves code maintainability and separation of concerns.

```java
@Aspect @Component public class LoggingAspect {
  @Pointcut("execution(* com.app.service.*.*(..))")
  void serviceMethods(){}

  @Before("serviceMethods()")
  public void logBefore(JoinPoint jp){
    System.out.println("Invoking: " + jp.getSignature());
  }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Differences between Aspect and Advice?
   **A**: Aspect is the module; advice is the action at a join point.
2. **Q**: How does Spring apply AOP?
   **A**: Runtime proxies weaving aspects into bean method calls.
3. **Q**: Types of advice available?
   **A**: `@Before`, `@After`, `@AfterReturning`, `@AfterThrowing`, `@Around`.

---

## 12. Introduction to Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)

**Use‑case**: Global exception handling across services.

**5 bullet points**:

* AOP separates concerns like logging & security.
* Enhances modularity of code.
* Advice executes at join points like method execution.
* Pointcuts define where advices apply.
* Aspects bundle pointcuts and advices into reusable modules.

**5-line summary**
AOP provides a powerful way to encapsulate cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security) into reusable modules (aspects). It defines where code should apply (`pointcut`) and what code runs (`advice`) at those points (`join points`). This leads to cleaner, more maintainable code by decoupling secondary concerns from business logic. Spring supports AOP with annotations and uses proxy-based weaving.

```java
@Aspect @Component public class ExceptionAspect {
  @AfterThrowing(pointcut="execution(* com.app.*.*(..))", throwing="ex")
  public void logError(Exception ex){ System.out.println("Error: " + ex); }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: What’s a join point?
   **A**: A point during execution of a program, like method execution.
2. **Q**: What’s a pointcut?
   **A**: Expression that selects join points for advice application.
3. **Q**: Difference between `@Around` and `@Before`?
   **A**: `@Around` controls invocation; `@Before` runs before execution only.

---

## 13. Understanding Problems in Web Applications Without AOP

**Use‑case**: Logging repeated across controllers.

**5 bullet points**:

* Repetitive logging across many services.
* Scattered security checks.
* Hard to maintain exception handling.
* Duplication leads to inconsistent behavior.
* Tightly coupled concerns making code brittle.

**5-line summary**
Without AOP, cross-cutting concerns in web apps—like logging, transactions, and security—are scattered and repeated across layers. This leads to code duplication, inconsistency, and maintenance headaches. There's no centralized way to enforce behavior across multiple classes, resulting in tightly coupled, brittle code structures.

```java
public class UserController {
  public User get(int id){
    System.out.println("Entering get()");
    try {
      return userService.get(id);
    } finally {
      System.out.println("Exiting get()");
    }
  }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**:

1. **Q**: Risks of repetitive logging?
   **A**: Bugs, divergence, poor maintainability.
2. **Q**: Tightly coupled code consequences?
   **A**: Harder to refactor and update cross-cutting concerns.
3. **Q**: How AOP addresses these issues?
   **A**: Centralizes behavior via aspects, reducing duplication.

---

## 14. Understanding & Running Application Without AOP

**Use‑case**: Plain service calls lacking cross-cutting logic.

**5 bullet points**:

* No proxy weaving—plain method invocation.
* No advice runs—methods unaware of logging/security.
* Hard-coded duplication across classes.
* Difficult tracking of cross-cutting behavior.
* Inefficient for large or evolving applications.

**5-line summary**
Running without AOP means services and controllers lack unified behavior for logging, security, or transactions. Each class must reimplement these concerns, leading to duplication and inconsistency. Performance is inefficient, and maintainability is low. AOP eliminates these issues by decoupling cross-cutting logic from core business code.
