## 1. What is Spring?

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* ✅ Enterprise-grade Java framework enabling easier integration, configuration, and extensibility in apps.
* 🚀 Provides modules for IoC/DI, JDBC, MVC, AOP, Security, and more.
* 🧩 Helps build loosely-coupled, testable, maintainable applications.
* 🤖 Powers microservices with Spring Boot support.
* 🔧 Reduces boilerplate via annotations and auto‑configuration.

**Summary**
Spring is a comprehensive Java framework that standardizes enterprise development by offering core services like inversion of control, AOP, security, and MVC. It promotes modularity, configuration flexibility (XML, Java, annotations), and integrates well with databases, messaging, and web services. Spring Boot simplifies setup with embedded servers and convention-over-configuration. It fosters testable, maintainable, production-grade systems suitable for cloud deployment.

```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan("com.example.app")
public class AppConfig { }

@Component
public class HelloService {
    public String sayHello() { return "Hello, Spring!"; }
}

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
        var svc = ctx.getBean(HelloService.class);
        System.out.println(svc.sayHello()); // prints Hello, Spring!
    }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: Why choose Spring over older frameworks like Struts or plain Servlets?
   **A**: Spring offers holistic support for DI, AOP, transaction management, REST, security, and testability, reducing boilerplate and enhancing modularity.

2. **Q**: What are major Spring modules?
   **A**: Spring Core (IoC/DI), AOP, Spring MVC, Spring Data/JDBC/JPA, Spring Security, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, etc.

3. **Q**: Can you use Spring without Spring Boot?
   **A**: Absolutely—Spring Core works standalone. Boot is optional and just streamlines configuration with embedded web server and starters.

## 2. Jakarta EE vs Spring

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 🔄 Both support dependency injection and web capabilities.
* 🤝 Jakarta EE uses standards (Servlet, CDI, JPA) via containers like Payara/WildFly.
* ⚙️ Spring uses its own contracts and often easier microservice-first stack via Boot.
* 📦 Deployment: Spring Boot produces self‑contained JARs; Jakarta EE runs on external app‑servers.
* 🧪 Testing: Spring Boot has embedded-test support via @SpringBootTest.

**Summary**
Jakarta EE and Spring are industry-leading Java ecosystems. Jakarta EE emphasizes standardized APIs with vendor-neutral containers (EJB, CDI, JAX-RS). Spring offers richer ecosystem, convention-over-configuration approach via Boot, fast startup, and standalone deployments. Use EE for pure-Java-standards consistency across vendors; Spring for flexibility, cloud readiness, and extensive ecosystem. Both can interop—Spring supports JPA, JAX-RS, etc.

```java
// Jakarta EE example: JAX-RS endpoint
@Path("/hello")
@RequestScoped
public class HelloResource {
    @GET @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello() { return "Hello, Jakarta EE!"; }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: When to pick Jakarta EE over Spring?
   **A**: Choose Jakarta EE when you need vendor-neutral portability and strict Java EE standard compliance.

2. **Q**: Can Spring Boot run on an external servlet container?
   **A**: Yes, by packaging as WAR and configuring a Servlet initializer instead of embedding Tomcat/Jetty.

3. **Q**: Does Spring fully support JPA?
   **A**: Yes—Spring Data JPA supports JPA implementations like Hibernate, EclipseLink.

## 3. Introduction to Spring Core

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 💡 Foundation of Spring, providing IoC container, bean lifecycle, DI.
* 📚 Includes ApplicationContext (BeanFactory), resource loading, property support.
* 🔧 Uses @Component, XML, or Java @Bean for bean definitions.
* 👁️‍🗨️ Supports environment abstraction, profiles, and event publishing.
* 🔄 Manages configuration and wiring across layers.

**Summary**
Spring Core is the heart of the framework—its IoC container instantiates, configures, and connects beans via various metadata sources. It offers ApplicationContext interface with lifecycle callbacks, property resolution, resource access, and event system. Beans can be discovered by scanning or declared manually. This abstraction simplifies program architecture by delegating wiring and lifecycle management.

```java
@Configuration
public class CoreConfig {
  @Bean
  public GreetingService greetingService() { return new GreetingServiceImpl(); }
}
public class App {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    var ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(CoreConfig.class);
    System.out.println(ctx.getBean(GreetingService.class).greet());
  }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: What’s the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext?
   **A**: ApplicationContext extends BeanFactory—it eagerly loads singleton beans, supports messages, events, and resource access, not just lazy instantiation.

2. **Q**: How do you define beans?
   **A**: Via XML, Java @Configuration methods with @Bean, or component-scanning using stereotypes (@Component, @Service).

3. **Q**: Can beans be prototype-scoped?
   **A**: Yes. Use `@Scope("prototype")` for multi-instance behavior instead of singleton.

## 4. Introduction to IoC & DI

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 🧩 IoC reverses control of object creation to framework.
* 🔌 DI injects dependencies (constructor, setter, field).
* 💻 Simplifies testing—swap implementations easily.
* 🔄 Promotes separation of concerns and loose coupling.
* 💡 Increases modularity and configuration flexibility.

**Summary**
Inversion of Control (IoC) delegates responsibility for managing object lifecycle and dependencies to the Spring container. Dependency Injection (DI) is an implementation of IoC—framework injects collaborators rather than objects manually wiring them. DI improves modularity, testability, and easier configuration. It supports constructor, setter, and field injection.

```java
@Component class A { }
@Component class B {
  private final A a;
  @Autowired
  public B(A a) { this.a = a; }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: Difference between setter and constructor injection?
   **A**: Constructor injection is recommended: makes dependencies required and immutable. Setter injection is optional or circular dependencies.

2. **Q**: Can DI be done without a framework?
   **A**: Yes, manually via new and passing in dependencies. IoC frameworks automate it and scale better.

3. **Q**: When would you use field injection?
   **A**: Rarely—only for test code or highly non‑modular cases. Constructor injection remains preferred.

## 5. Demo of IoC & DI

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 🏗️ Show a real component wiring scenario.
* 👨‍💻 Demonstrates automatic instantiation and injection.
* 🧪 Includes a mock configuration for testing.
* ✅ Shows one-to-many implementation injection.
* 🔁 Wiring via Java config or XML.

**Summary**
In this demo, we define interfaces and implementations wired by Spring. We show constructor injection and switching implementations via profiles or config. This demonstrates loose coupling and easy test swapping. The demo proves DI in action, where class B doesn’t create A but receives it through IoC container wiring.

```java
public interface MessageProvider { String getMessage(); }
@Component @Profile("dev")
public class DevMessageProvider implements MessageProvider { public String getMessage() { return "Dev"; } }
@Component @Profile("prod")
public class ProdMessageProvider implements MessageProvider { public String getMessage() { return "Prod"; } }

@Component class UseMessage {
  private final MessageProvider provider;
  @Autowired
  public UseMessage(MessageProvider provider) { this.provider = provider; }
  public void show() { System.out.println(provider.getMessage()); }
}

public class Demo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.setProperty("spring.profiles.active", "dev");
    var ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext("com.example");
    ctx.getBean(UseMessage.class).show(); // prints "Dev"
  }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: What if multiple beans match DI type?
   **A**: Use @Qualifier or @Primary to resolve ambiguity.

2. **Q**: How to change profile at runtime?
   **A**: Set spring.profiles.active via System property, environment var, or application.properties.

3. **Q**: How to inject a collection of beans?
   **A**: `@Autowired List<MyInterface> allImpls;` injects all matching beans.

## 6. Advantages of IoC & DI

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 🔁 Decoupling implementation from usage.
* 🧪 Easier unit testing via mocks.
* 🔄 Easier to swap implementations in deployment.
* 🔍 Centralized wiring and lifecycle management.
* 🌱 Encourages single responsibility and cleaner modules.

**Summary**
IoC and DI improve code quality by decoupling components and externalizing wiring. This boosts modularity, simplifies testing, and allows flexible configuration without code changes. This style aids maintainability, supports evolving requirements, and enables easier refactoring. In large apps, IoC avoids tight coupling and deep dependency chains.

```java
@Service class AService { }
@Service class BService {
  private final AService aService;
  @Autowired BService(AService a) { this.aService = a; }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: How does DI enhance testing?
   **A**: You can inject mocks or stubs instead of real implementations in unit tests.

2. **Q**: What inversion of control containers are besides Spring?
   **A**: Google Guice, Jakarta CDI (Weld/OpenWebBeans), PicoContainer.

3. **Q**: Any disadvantages to DI?
   **A**: Some learning curve, container complexity, potential runtime misconfiguration.

## 7. Introductions to Beans, Context, and SpEL

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 🧩 "Bean": managed object in Spring container.
* 🌳 "Context": ApplicationContext gives lifecycle, DI, event, resource APIs.
* 🔤 SpEL: Spring Expression Language used in annotations like `@Value`.
* 🔍 SpEL supports method calls, arithmetic, collection access.
* 🛠️ Leverages SpEL for dynamic configuration and condition evaluation.

**Summary**
Beans are Spring-managed objects declared via XML, Java, or annotations. The ApplicationContext is the central factory for beans, configuration, and eventing. SpEL empowers dynamic expressions such as property access, math, conditional, and calling custom functions. Used in `@Value`, bean definitions, security, and conditional loading.

```java
@Value("#{T(java.lang.Math).random() * 100}")
private double rand;

@Value("#{systemProperties['user.home']}")
private String homeDir;
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: What’s SpEL vs JSP EL or OGNL?
   **A**: SpEL is for Spring metadata config with method execution, arithmetic, indexing—embedded in annotations/XML.

2. **Q**: Can SpEL reference other beans?
   **A**: Yes: `@Value("#{otherBean.someProperty}")`

3. **Q**: What happens on SpEL parse error?
   **A**: Context initialization fails with ExpressionException.

## 8. Introduction to Spring IoC Container

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 🏛️ IoC Container manages bean instantiation, wiring, lifecycle.
* 📦 Bean definitions loaded via ApplicationContext from Java, XML, or classpath.
* 🔁 Supports scopes: singleton, prototype, request, session.
* 🔄 Supports lifecycle callbacks like `@PostConstruct` & `@PreDestroy`.
* 🔍 Also supports Aware interfaces, events, and custom post‑processors.

**Summary**
The Spring IoC Container, represented by BeanFactory/ApplicationContext, is the runtime environment where beans live. It uses metadata to instantiate, configure, and link beans, supports scopes and lifecycle, and adds cross‑cutting services like events. Developers define beans via Java classes, XML, or scan for annotated components. The container handles dependency resolution, lifecycle hooks, and context-wide features.

```java
@Configuration
public class Cfg {
  @Bean(initMethod="init", destroyMethod="cleanup")
  public ResourceHolder rh() { return new ResourceHolder(); }
}
public class Demo {
  var ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(Cfg.class);
  ctx.close(); // triggers destroyMethod
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: How do prototype scoping and container shutdown differ?
   **A**: Prototype beans aren’t tracked by context, so destroy callbacks aren’t called automatically.

2. **Q**: What is BeanPostProcessor?
   **A**: Interface to apply custom logic before/after bean initialization.

3. **Q**: What is BeanFactoryPostProcessor?
   **A**: Modifies bean definitions before container bean instantiation begins.

## 9. “Introduction to Spring Framework” Quiz

1. **Q**: What annotation is used to mark a configuration class?

   * **A**: `@Configuration`

2. **Q**: How do you declare a bean with XML config?

   * **A**: `<bean id="userService" class="com.example.UserService"/>`

3. **Q**: What does `@Autowired` do?

   * **A**: Marks a field, constructor, or setter for dependency injection by type.

## 10. Creating Beans inside Spring Context

**Use‑case & Explanation**

* 📦 Beans defined through Java @Bean or @Component scanning.
* 🌲 Configuration classes act as bean factories.
* ♻️ You can create beans programmatically using `registrar.registerBean()`.
* 🔁 Beans can be conditionally created via `@Conditional`, `@Profile`.
* 🧪 Useful for dynamic or modular bean registration.

**Summary**
Spring allows bean registration via annotations and XML. Java-based configuration via `@Bean` is concise and type-safe. `@Component` with scanning auto-detects. You can also manually register beans at runtime using `GenericApplicationContext.registerBean()`, enabling dynamic modules or plugin patterns. Conditional annotations help fine-tune when beans exist.

```java
public class DynamicDemo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    var ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();
    ctx.register(DynamicDemo.class);
    ctx.registerBean("foo", String.class, () -> "Dynamically registered");
    ctx.refresh();
    System.out.println(ctx.getBean("foo"));
    ctx.close();
  }
}
```

**Interview Q\&A**

1. **Q**: How to register beans at runtime?
   **A**: Use `registerBean()` on `GenericApplicationContext` before `refresh()`.

2. **Q**: What’s the advantage of Java @Bean over XML?
   **A**: Type safety, easier refactoring, IDE support, and conditional registration via code.

3. **Q**: Can two beans share the same class?
   **A**: Yes—give them different names via `@Bean("name")` or `@Component("...")`.
